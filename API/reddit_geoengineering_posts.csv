17m83dc,How long until governments publicly and drastically deploy geoengineering efforts?,thelastofthebastion,129,109,"With more outlets publicly discussing the potential destabilization of society from the effects of climate change, I feel like it’s only a matter of time until governments hit the panic button and deploy any and all geoengineering effort regardless of research development stages or unintended consequences. 

China’s summers have been extremely lethal for the past few years from what I’ve skimmed over, and I believe they are already deploying some local weather modification efforts. Are there any Chinese /r/collapse users who could educate me on what the social climate in China around the climate collapse is? I would assume much less climate deniers, for one..

But my main focus is on the U.S. Government specifically. If next summer is as deadly as we project, then I would expect the climate crisis to be a major point of contention in the 2024 Presidential Election—especially if the Fatality count really is in the **millions**. Afterwards, the victor will make one of their first acts in office deploying a geoengineering project to assure the nation’s safety.

2035 two million people die in a heatwave in Chennai after three weeks of 50c and a blackout prevents air conditioning.  

2036 India unilaterally begins injecting Sulphur aerosols into the stratosphere above India. 

2037 world climate chaos continues but many people begin blaming India.  After a  massive famine and floods in Bangladesh, their government   blames Indian climate manipulation and insists the program be halted.

2040 record floods and more mass casualty events  occur in India.  New government is elected and multiples Sulfur injections by 10 despite world condemnation 

2045 after continued climate chaos the Indian government loses the election and the opposition blame the Sulfur program.  The program is stopped .  There is a dramatic sudden spike in temperatures and climate chaos intensifies.

k7lcie3,t3_17m83dc,Classic-Today-4367,16,0,"I'm in China. We've been having temps around 28 - 30C every day for the past few weeks, which is kinda unusual this late in the year. But then again, not that unusual in recent years.

I had an epiphany the other day about China+geo-engineering. Basically, the past few summers have been way warmer than is usual, especially the record-breaking highs and number of hot days last year.

From what I can gather, these hotter summers partly have happened since the economy has stagnated. Basically, geo-engineering in reverse --- whereas before the factories were putting out huge amounts of smog that basically blocked some of the sun's rays, there are now a lot more ""blue sky days"" because so many industrial pants have closed down, meaning those rays are getting through. I'm not sure if this is empirically correct, but there does seem to be some correlation.

There has also been some small-scale geo-engineering with cloud seeing the past few years. We were in semi-drought from late 2020 basically until earlier in this year. The government tried to fix that by cloud-seeding to cause rain. Which did work, except it actually caused storms and heavy rain in districts directly affected but only short light showers or even no rain  in adjoining parts.

This was most recently used during the Asian Games held a few weeks ago, where it rained right up until a few hours before the opening ceremony and then just stopped. Was later confirmed they had used the rockets to make it rain a lot in preceding days so it wouldn't affect the ceremony.",COMMENT

Later we'll discover that they lower birth rates, IQ, testosterone and cause cancer.

No one would probably do it out in the open due to liability and any geo engineering efforts are equally likely to produce unexpected catastrophic events - for example if you block light into the oceans there will be less plankton/algae which will impact oxygen production and the food chain and also weather systems with less energy going into the sea.",COMMENT

jlath7d,t3_13pmpmq,GalacticKiss,13,1,"A few things I'm a little confused on:

I don't understand how some of the rivers are sustained. For example, the Atlas river in the west. You wrote about greater evaporation and cloud seeding, but  cloud seeding can't make rain if there isn't water vapor already in the air, and there aren't any lakes evaporating to the west of the Atlas River.

How/why would countries along the Nile agree to split off some of the water flowing down it towards the north? In order to sustain large agriculture, water diversions are already a huge issue. Taking a good portion of that water to fill a lake elsewhere seems both politically untenable and ill advised.

I don't understand what purpose the canal in the far south east serves. It cuts out a bend in the river, meaning that area gets less water and less sediment, but for no appreciable geoengineering benefit.

Also, shouldn't the hydroelectric dams be curved the other way? They curve with the center towards the high body of water and the ends towards the lower body.

And isn't extracting from underground aquafiurs rather unsustainable when done to such a large degree?

As such the simplest and already occurring way to greenify the Sahara is to raise its temperature to cause a low pressure during summer which then allows for the monsoon clouds of the Atlantic to reach further into the Sahara. The easiset way to increase rainfall for the Sahara would be install a stupid amount of heat absorbing and retaining material or such to cause the local temperature to rise and through this pull the monsoon rains furhter into the Sahara.

If the carbon tax revenue is rebated equally to the public as a “carbon dividend”, [roughly 70%](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/WP-115.pdf) of people would see a net financial benefit, with lower income brackets gaining the most.  This type of policy is supported by literally the [largest public statement](https://www.econstatement.org/) of economists in history.  After [30 years of data](https://www.resourcesmag.org/archives/carbon-taxes-do-not-harm-jobs-or-economic-growth/?utm_source=Resources+for+the+Future&utm_campaign=3aa3559876-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_10_21_01_50&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e896179bd7-3aa3559876-100734037) on countries with carbon taxes, there is no evidence that carbon taxes harm jobs or economic growth.  In fact, the immediate local benefits of reducing emissions [exceed costs](https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/17535/NCA_paper_accepted_version.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y), *even* [*before considering climate benefits*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9).  It [grows GDP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-020-02699-1), as people produce more when alive/healthy.  Rebating 100% of the carbon tax revenue immediately back into the public [helps further](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy).

We have known this as early as the 70's and we have only adopted more ways in which to send chlorine and bromine into the stratosphere. Generally they're found in compounds relatively harmless in the teoposphere, etc. but when reacting with the sun's intense UV radiation in the stratosphere chlorine and bromine will split from whatever compound they're in and then starts doing their damage.

However, it's not just ONE atom per compound, it's many many atoms. 
so it's many hundreds of thousand ozone molecules destroyed, which is how we got that hole. 

The problem with that hole is that it increases the danger exponentially, because without an ozone layer the earth is bombarded with harsher UV radiation beyond the stratorphere, so now were creating even more free chlorine atoms.

Consumption in general (as in buying both food and non-food) doesn't cause environmental crises, but the overconsumption of what humanity is consuming is causing the biosphere's biggest problems including climate change. My Biology teacher told me last week that well over half of anthropogenic extinctions are caused by habitat loss (e.g. deforestation) combined with exploitation (e.g. over-fishing), while a currently rising 7% of anthropogenic extinctions on earth are caused by climate change. I believe Humans tend to consume more when stressed, and headlines like these stress me the duck out.

j1nhtuc,t3_zuyk0d,atthenius,5,1,"I don’t really want to regularly comment on r/climate, but no one has highlighted how SRM / solar radiation management / Volcanoes / injection of aerosol precursors into the stratosphere can be REAL BAD. SMH moderators, what / where the heck are you. At least link some popsci.

SRM or solar resource management is humans trying to co-opt the way strato-volcanic eruptions impact the earth. We have quite a few natural examples to draw from.

These Sunset guys are thinking of a SRM on order 1 W/m2 forcing… volcanic eruptions like 1991 Mt Pinatubo are like 5-7 times that size *at peak*. 1991 Pinatubo injected something like 18 Tg SO2 into the stratosphere and 150 Mt H2O. !!! HUGE !!! Much bigger than these sunset guys are claiming at present. 1991 Pinatubo caused a peak decrease in global temperature of 0.5degC. 

1) It is true that increasing the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere with sulfate aerosols (or ash or dust or a whole host of other mostly non-absorbing aerosols) can decrease the temperature of the troposphere

2) It is pretty obvious that if sunlight or INcoming SOLar radiATION gets caught up with aerosols scattering back to space in the stratosphere, that there is cooling in the troposphere… but also some WARMING in the stratosphere … because some of the insolation won’t be scattered but absorbed.

3) Stratospheric chemistry is *VERY* complicated. The ozone layer is delicate. Messing with the temperature of the stratosphere, the chemical composition of the stratosphere, including injection of SO2 or H2O, can mess up ozone because of a chemical pathway impacting the destruction of ozone through OH radicals availability. Ozone in the stratosphere is good for people (skin cancer w/o it!)… and its destruction / creation also can cause regional temperature anomalies of a couple degrees C.

4) Global temperatures and hydrologic cycle are intimately linked. If you increase stratospheric aerosols, you decrease the amount of direct / shortwave insolation reaching the earth’s surface. Evaporation occurs most readily with that direct shortwave insolation, so volcanic aerosols or SRM will inevitably also decrease shortwave to the earth’s surface and decrease evaporation. Why is that important:: precipitation and evaporation MUST balance to first order. IOW: SRM aerosols likely mean lower temperatures AND lower precipitation. 

5) Volcanic / SRM clouds are ephemeral wispy things that do not cause global changes. Any region (think an area of earth the size of Europe or Australia) can have the opposite impact of global. Some things that have been suggested for the year following a volcanoes (and thus also for SRM):: winter warming of Europe. Predilection for a positive El Nino Southern Oscillation state. 

6) Because the impacts of stratospheric aerosols are ephemeral and not globally homogeneous, you can get weird regional things. Like, in the past, volcanic activity in the Northern Hemisphere would cool that hemisphere preferentially, shifting global tropical rain bands called the ‘Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone’ into the southern hemisphere and depriving massive areas of the rain needed to have a ‘normal’ climate.

7) In human history, many of the greatest (most tragic) famines were associated with times of increased volcanism. Plants actually need shortwave radiation for photosynthesis. Its nice to be warm, but its better to have plant food. SRM could decrease crop yields and all sorts of things directly from the radiative changes (not to mention the precipitation and temperature changes from above).

8) Although there *are* natural examples of volcanoes… there aren’t THAT many. The empirical evidence for how volcanoes impact climate is *extremely* limited in the satellite era (1980-today). Pretty much only 1991 Mt Pinatubo was observed that well. (1982 El Chichon much less so… plus it is only ~⅓ the size of 91Pinatubo). We have models for how the climate will respond to forcing excess aerosols into the stratosphere, but relatively little constraint. SRM folks are forcing us all into uncharted territory.

9) There are no geopolitical boundaries in the stratosphere. Stuff goes where the background circulation (brewer Dobson) and chemistry requires. The good part of that is that if the aerosols injected into the stratosphere are volcano-sized (~0.5 μm) and not TEENY, this circulation will remove stuff in 4-5 years, depending on size and level of injection.

In closing… I wish it was someone else writing this information. I’m a little skeptical of what Sunset guys are claiming thus far. I haven’t seen any independent verification of what they are claiming (no judgement— literally, I haven’t seen anything).

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Termin8tor:

---

In a future of wildly escalating global temperatures, potential crop failures and other catastrophic climate change related disasters, we may see serious consideration put into deploying measures to geoengineer the climate in a desperate bid to reduce global average temperature.

According to [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/geoengineering-could-turn-skies-white/), Geoengineering via sulfate particles to reduce incoming solar radiation by 2% at Earths surface would be enough to potentially scatter light and leave the world in a permanent white haze, akin to a polluted city. 

Sulfate concentrations sufficient to block 2% of solar radiation might also be enough to increase the brightness of the sky by three to five times.

It's not difficult to imagine that geoengineering may well be deployed in the future. This could disrupt plant and animal life and is therefore collapse related and thus pleases Skeletor.

> Two studies noted that when planes stopped flying on 11–14 September 2001, the average daily temperature range in the United States rose markedly, exceeding the three-day periods before and after by an average of 1.8 °C. The unusual size of the shift, says David Travis of the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, who led both of the earlier studies, implied that an absence of contrails gave the temperature range a significant boost. But that idea, he says, was ""more like a hypothesis"" than a firm conclusion.

Nova transcript on [global dimming](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3310_sun.html)

> NARRATOR: Travis was not looking just at temperature, which varies a lot from day to day. Instead he focused on something that normally changes quite slowly: the temperature range, the difference between the highest temperature during the day and the lowest at night. Had this changed at all during the three days of the grounding?

> DAVID TRAVIS:	As we began to look at the climate data and the evidence began to grow, I got more and more excited. The actual results were much larger than I expected.

> So here we see, for the three-day period preceding September 11th, a slightly negative value of temperature range with lots of contrails, as normal. Then we have this sudden spike right here of the three-day period. This reflects lack of clouds, lack of contrails, warmer days cooler nights, exactly what we expected, but even larger than we expected.

> NARRATOR: During the three-day grounding, the nights had gotten colder and the days, warmer. Averaged over the whole continental U.S., the temperature difference between day and night had suddenly increased by over a degree Celsius or two degrees Fahrenheit. Travis had never seen anything like it before.

> DAVID TRAVIS:	This was the largest temperature swing of this magnitude in the last 30 years.

> NARRATOR: Manmade clouds from aircraft are a minor contributor to global dimming. If removing them had such a dramatic effect, what would happen if air pollution were to be reduced all over the world?

> DAVID TRAVIS:	The 9/11 study showed that if you remove a contributor to global dimming, jet contrails, just for a three-day period, we see an immediate response of the surface temperature. Do the same thing globally, we might see a large-scale increase in global warming.

The interesting part of all of that is that the weather and temperature returned to normal within a day or two.

It also points to things that we can do  *now* without any additional changes.  Limit the red-eye flights.  Clear skies at night will let more heat escape.  Likewise, if the fuel is changed to a different mixture that produces more particulate or water vapor, that would increase the daytime dimming effect.",COMMENT

While thousands of people in London block bridges, demanding more action on climate, tens of thousands in France protest against new eco-friendly tax on fuels. Energiewende in Germany failed, spectacular, leading to higher costs, grid instability and slower decrease of emissions, according to report by German government itself. 

And let's not forget billions of people, who are too poor and desperate to care about climate change and want their living standards to increase. And only way to do that quickly is, guess what, to use fossil fuels. So it's not going to get much better in near future.

gaahogf,t3_jj2v7c,Gavinwadz,30,5,"I was thinking about rapid climate change the other day. I think the main hurdle is that people have come to expect a certain standard of living that includes luxuries. We need to have a large wardrobe of clothes for every occasion rather than a handful of outfits we like. We need to have a large refrigerator stuffed with meat and cheese, when we could just buy ingredients for meal preparation as part of a daily routine.

In my mind, this is also the least solvable problem. Luxury has become the default. And changing people's minds on this is not feasible. On the other hand, I think the counterculture to materialism is growing in this generation. So maybe there's a chance for change.

While I was thinking about these things, I started wondering about the diminishing importance of cities. With the advent of the Internet (and the rapid shift to remote working due to Covid), it's becoming apparent that proximity isn't important for many of the world's jobs. Some companies don't even have a central headquarters; all the employees work from home.

All right, here's the point I'm aiming at. I wonder if it would be beneficial to the environment if we started decentralizing humanity, scattering into smaller ""villages"" instead of packing into choked cities. Each ""village"" would need a strong Internet connection, but they might be able to be mostly self-sufficient. People without absurdly advanced skillsets could simply work for the village in construction or farming or something, while others could work remotely.

Imagine if you lived in a community of around 1,000 people, away from any large cities. All of your needs can be found within a radius of a few miles, eliminating the need for everyone to own a personal vehicle. Not only would this decrease the rate of CO2 emissions, but it would allow many people to regain a feeling of importance and contribution to society.

Anyway, this is probably all wishful thinking. But like many people, I'm concerned about the way the world is going. And it will take significant action to make any kind of change.",COMMENT

Ok so we gonna need to extract roughly 4000Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere **that we do nothing with** until 2100. That means we need 50,000 plants fully operational now. We don't have that. So let's say we build all the plants we need in the coming 20 years. That means we only have 60 years to let them run, so we need to build 67,000 plants instead. But wait there's more, running these plants will also produce 2000Gt CO2 from the burning of natural gas... So effectively we only capture 0.5 Mt CO2 per year and plant. So we need not 67,000 plants, but 130,000 plants.

Ok, the extraction cost is $150/t-CO2, so that's $1200 trillion, about 7% of the world GDP from 2040 to 2100 assuming 2.5% annual growth. The electricity needed will be 2 million TWh, or 12% the energy that the world produces in 60 years assuming 1.67% annual energy production growth. The plants will require 4600 km^(3) of natural gas, or 2.6% of our reserves.

And all this, is *just* to avoid climate catastrophe, none of this leads to ""carbon neutral transportation fuel"", if you want to do that you have to build a lot more plants and use more natural gas.

A point that has to be understood is that Climate change is not merely a rise in the average temperature, it's a fundamental change in the Chemistry of the earth, there is this impression among some people that the biggest impact of climate change will be caused by big natural disasters and as such if we mitigate that with big sweeping Pancras we can avoid the worst.

Using it after temperatures have peaked is losing a lot of the benefit. Yet this would require using geoengineering in the near future, which seems unlikely.

I think all these things combine to make using geoengineering unlikely to be used, and that's not even considering the public pressure against using such a technique.

How is this article related to the collapse of civilization?  I think it's pretty straightforward:

> Geoengineering, theoretically, aims to restore that balance, either by removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or reflecting solar energy away from Earth.

> But changing Earth's complex and interconnected climate system may have unintended consequences. **Changes that help one region could harm another**, and the effects may not be clear until it's too late.

As the damaged climate spirals out of control, making life more and more difficult, climate engineering will become inevitable.  But it's a complicated world with diverse weather problems, and nations will pursue their own self interests at the expense of other nations.  Aside from just having the potential to go wrong, this also has the potential to drive wars.

During the Cold War, research into weather manipulation was further funded, opening up the possibility of using weather as a weapon. ""

- Star-forts: Star-forts exist all over the world, but are very geometrically precise and defy any known ability to produce. Many have been destroyed, or obscured to cover up their existence. 

- Obelisks: Obelisks are found in every culture and many meet the same specifications, despite the cultures being seemingly strangers to one another.

- Pyramids: Pyramids continue to pop up in the most unlikely places, and once again, in cultures that history tells us never interacted with each other.

I just ordered it.
I'm absolutely fascinated with this subject. I did a deep dive into cataclysms and the cyclical nature of our reality.  I read Chan Thomas's book, The Adam and Eve Story, and Velikofski as well. I've been checking out the DieHold Foundation. I know this isn't exactly the same thing as the mud flood, but it is certainly similar. 

There are a couple of guys that I've heard on podcasts talking about this. 

Have you heard of Max Igan?
He was the first person I heard talk about the mudflood.

Lately, I've been listening to Archaix. 
He has several videos on YouTube. 
He believes we live in something called a simulacrum. It is an interesting theory, punctuated by cyclical disasters, he calls the Phoenix phenomenon.",COMMENT

I used to listen to Archaix. I was listening/watching him about 4 years back. He used to be a strong Christian back when he had a few thousand subs. Then, he inexplicably renounced his religion and said that he no longer believes in it. He blew up shortly thereafter. Kind of spooky how he dropped JESUS from his show, and he is able to do youtube full-time almost immediately thereafter. I kind of stopped watching him then. 

However, he has great information on the Pheonix phenomenon and the 130+/- year cycle that it follows.

The World's Fairs are a mystery tied to the mudflood theory, as well. The fairs were simply repopulation parties where everyone would show up for the exposition and move into the area. It is all a long, and strange trip, but it definitely helped me answer a lot of questions that I always had. I never could reconcile how America populated, and adequately built the country so quickly.

Mind unveiled is another great youtube channel. Mind unveiled is kind of like Jason Brashears. He seems to be drawn to the occult aspect that is inextricably tied to the elite class.

The recent report from the United Nations Environment Programme on solar geoengineering is a significant development in climate change research. The report highlights the potential of these technologies to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space or making it easier for heat to escape. However, it also emphasizes the need for a full-scale global review to investigate their potentials and dangers. While solar geoengineering is not a silver bullet solution to climate change, it could buy us some time while we work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We must approach this technology with caution and prioritize reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.

I've been studying solar geoengineering for over a decade and I believe that if used wisely it has the potential to greatly reduce the risks of climate change. Given the slow progress on emissions cuts and the growing impacts of climate change, I think this is an idea that might actually be developed and deployed in the coming decades.

I've published over 30 articles on solar geoengineering, including:

* A fairly accessible [overview](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.423) of the science of solar geoengineering.
* A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0398-8) where we show it would reduce most climate changes in most places, worsening some climate changes in only a tiny fraction of places.
* A [comment](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000465) where we argue that it could reduce overall climate risks substantially and \*might\* reduce overall climate risks in ALL regions.

I'm also a co-host of the [Challenging Climate podcast](https://www.challengingclimate.org/1873533) where we interview leading climate experts and others about the climate problem. We've had sci-fi author [Neal Stephenson](https://www.challengingclimate.org/1873533/9859141-neal-stephenson-on-solar-geoengineering-and-termination-shock), Pulitzer prize winner [Elizabeth Kolbert](https://www.challengingclimate.org/1873533/10272506-elizabeth-kolbert-on-climate-change-extinctions-and-life-under-a-white-sky), and climate scientist [Prof. Gavin Schmidt](https://www.challengingclimate.org/1873533/10377514-gavin-schmidt-on-observing-attributing-and-communicating-climate-change).

SS: Countries must urgently agree a way of controlling and regulating attempts to geoengineer the climate, and consider whether to set a moratorium on such efforts, as the danger of global heating exceeding the 1.5C threshold increases, the former head of the World Trade Organisation has warned.

Pascal Lamy, a former director-general of the WTO and a former EU trade commissioner, now president of the Paris Peace Forum, said governments were increasingly likely to explore the possibilities of geoengineering, as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions have so far been inadequate.

“Given where we are, we have to seriously consider the risk of overshooting 1.5C,” said Lamy. “That is a huge risk. All of the ways by which we can alleviate this risk must be evaluated. I think a global effort on geoengineering could work.”

Simultaneously it increases ocean biomass by radically increasing the width of the bottom of the food chain.  Helping with population rebounds from fishing.

We already have tens of thousands of boats out there.  It would cost almost nothing to have them sprinkle fine rust dust behind them as they go.  Industrial iron 2 oxide powder is like under $1000 a tonne.

jmbyzo5,t3_13weh6t,Judinous,9,1,"I hope that we don't utilize strategies like solar geoengineering, because they don't address the underlying problem of unsustainable behavior.  People often tunnel on global temperature rise because it's an easy to measure and understand metric, but it's only one piece of the self-inflicted polycrisis puzzle.  It's great for mass messaging because we can point at the graph and say ""If it gets to here on the chart, we all die!  We need to turn this trend around!"", which is simple to communicate and understand, but the reality is obviously much more complex than that.  Reducing the temperature doesn't save our species on its own.

Even if solar geoengineering is successful (and that's an *enormous* ""if""), it doesn't stop all that excess CO2 from acidifying the oceans.  It doesn't stop plastic usage.  It doesn't bring back topsoil.  It doesn't magic nitrogen and phosphorous for farming into existence.  It doesn't reduce water usage.  It doesn't reduce industrial insecticide usage.  It doesn't restore biodiversity (the temperature whiplash might even be detrimental overall).  And so on.

However, what it *would* do is give society an excuse to continue BAU over-consumption of resources and general destruction of the planet.  In fact, it would make it mandatory -- if solar geoengineering was active and working to keep us at a specific temperature, we would be *forced* to keep GHG levels high in order to not slip into an ice age.  Maybe we'd have more fine-tuned control to remove them quickly in that kind of situation, sure, but it's obvious from historical behavior that giving humanity that extra emissions runway means people will use that runway.  By just treating a single symptom in this way, we are now locked in to having to find magical treatments for every symptom instead of just fixing the underlying problem.

Now, I'm not saying that we need a magical solution that fixes every problem at once.  There is and can be no such thing (short of some external event like a disease doing our species a solid and wiping out 75%+ of the global population, I suppose).  However, the situation we are in is akin to a person with type-2 diabetes:  certainly, you can take a wide swath of medications to treat all the individual symptoms.  It may, in fact, be necessary to keep you alive in the moment when things are dire.  However, all it does is slow your deterioration if you don't change your underlying behavior.  You have to change your diet, eat less, and exercise more.  All of them at once.  Or die.  Those are the two options.

Solar geoengineering is the equivalent of a T2 diabetic taking insulin so they can keep chugging cans of soda.  It's not the answer to the problem.  It's obviously still self-destructive behavior.

This is to say nothing of the specific issues with solar geoengineering itself, of course.  Once you're intentionally modifying the climate, you become responsible for the climate.  Lowering the temperature comes with plenty of negatives, too -- areas that would have otherwise been fine without your modification are now under drought or floods or heat waves or freezes or whatever else...and it's now *your* fault, specifically (whoever or whatever government it is that launched these things), instead of a vague *everybody's* fault.  It's a classic trolley problem.  Changing the climate as an unintentional side-effect is ethically and most likely legally very different from doing it intentionally.  Manslaughter and murder are both crimes, but carry very different punishments.  Even if you're shooting someone in self-defense, if you hit an unrelated bystander, you're still probably getting charged with manslaughter.  Nation-states will now (justifiably) point the finger at whoever launched these things for every single natural disaster.  It's not a recipe for a peaceful world.",COMMENT

Something like solar radiation management may be employed, the spraying/injecting of cooling aerosols, such as sulfur dioxide, to block excess sunlight.

Other solutions proposed have many flaws and are unsustainable at scale and require enormous amounts energy in an age of peak oil and resource contraction/depletion, such as direct air carbon capture/DACC facilities. As Alice Friedmann writes, 

"" Several papers are summarized below. The most important is by Sekera and Lichtenberger (2020). This is the most complete, up-to-date review of where carbon capture stands today. They shown that the two most popular carbon dioxide removal methods likely to be funded, with taxpayer money, **generate more CO2 than they capture**. No private investor would spend a penny on this. . . Direct Air Capture (DAC) doesn’t scale up. To keep pace with [global CO2 emissions – currently 36 gigatonnes per year](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions) – would require over 30,000 large-scale DAC plants, [more than three for every coal-fired power station operating in the world today](https://www.carbonbrief.org/direct-co2-capture-machines-could-use-quarter-global-energy-in-2100). Each plant would cost [up to $500m to build](https://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Oxy-moves-forward-on-Permian-direct-air-capture-13867251.php) for a grand total of $15 trillion. To store 10 gigatonnes of CO2 a year would require four million tonnes of potassium hydroxide, 1.5 times more than the world-wide supply. Running them would take 100 exajoules, a sixth of all global energy to heat the calciner to around 1,500 F (800 C), so each DAC plant would need a gas furnace, and a ready supply of gas. Electricity can’t do this (Swain 2021). Microsoft found that DAC was 50 times more expensive per metric ton than other solutions (Joppa 2021)"".

While it appears that their initial runs released a negligible amount of chemicals, there is no real reason to trust them to not release more significant amounts in the future.  This company will not be the last one to explore this potential market in the near future, and if and when that happens in earnest we could see the destructive, myopic, and under-regulated behavior that dominates Silicon Valley used to ""disrupt"" the atmosphere.   Different organizations using different methods and attempting to sell different sorts of services to who knows who for who knows what purpose.  Disquieting to say the least.

Here is the open letter from the scientists:  
OPEN LETTER  
We Call for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering  
We call for immediate political action from governments, the United Nations, and other actors to prevent the normalization of solar geoengineering as a climate policy option. Governments and the United Nations must assert effective political control and restrict the development of solar geoengineering technologies at planetary scale. Specifically, we call for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering.

View Signatories  
Solar geoengineering⎯a set of hypothetical technologies to reduce incoming sunlight on earth⎯is gaining prominence in debates on climate policy. Several scientists have launched research projects on solar geoengineering, and some see it as a potential future policy option.  
  
To us, these proliferating calls for solar geoengineering research and development are cause for alarm. We share three fundamental concerns:  
  
First, the risks of solar geoengineering are poorly understood and can never be fully known. Impacts will vary across regions, and there are uncertainties about the effects on weather patterns, agriculture, and the provision of basic needs of food and water.  
  
Second, speculative hopes about the future availability of solar geoengineering technologies threaten commitments to mitigation and can disincentivize governments, businesses, and societies to do their utmost to achieve decarbonization or carbon neutrality as soon as possible. The speculative possibility of future solar geoengineering risks becoming a powerful argument for industry lobbyists, climate denialists, and some governments to delay decarbonization policies.  
  
Third, the current global governance system is unfit to develop and implement the far-reaching agreements needed to maintain fair, inclusive, and effective political control over solar geoengineering deployment. The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Environment Programme or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are all incapable of guaranteeing equitable and effective multilateral control over deployment of solar geoengineering technologies at planetary scale. The United Nations Security Council, dominated by only five countries with veto power, lacks the global legitimacy that would be required to effectively regulate solar geoengineering deployment.  
  
These concerns also arise with informal governance arrangements such as multi-stakeholder dialogues or voluntary codes of conduct. Informal arrangements face barriers to entry by less powerful actors and risk contributing to premature legitimization of these speculative technologies. Science networks are dominated by a few industrialized countries, with less economically powerful countries having little or no direct control over them. Technocratic governance based on expert commissions cannot adjudicate complex global conflicts over values, risk allocation and differences in risk acceptance that arise within the context of solar geoengineering.  
  
Without effective global and democratic controls, the geopolitics of possible unilateral deployment of solar geoengineering would be frightening and inequitable. Given the anticipated low monetary costs of some of these technologies, there is a risk that a few powerful countries would engage in solar geoengineering unilaterally or in small coalitions even when a majority of countries oppose such deployment.  
  
In short, solar geoengineering deployment cannot be governed globally in a fair, inclusive, and effective manner. We therefore call for immediate political action from governments, the United Nations, and other actors to prevent the normalization of solar geoengineering as a climate policy option. Governments and the United Nations should take effective political control and restrict the development of solar geoengineering technologies before it is too late. We advocate for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering specifically targeted against the development and deployment of such technologies at planetary scale.  
  
The International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering should commit governments to five core prohibitions and measures:   
  
The commitment to prohibit their national funding agencies from supporting the development of technologies for solar geoengineering, domestically and through international institutions.  
The commitment to ban outdoor experiments of solar geoengineering technologies in areas under their jurisdiction.  
The commitment to not grant patent rights for technologies for solar geoengineering, including supporting technologies such as for the retrofitting of airplanes for aerosol injections.  
The commitment to not deploy technologies for solar geoengineering if developed by third parties.  
The commitment to object to future institutionalization of planetary solar geoengineering as a policy option in relevant international institutions, including assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  
An International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering would not prohibit atmospheric or climate research as such, and it would not place broad limitations on academic freedom. The agreement would instead focus solely on a specific set of measures targeted purely at restricting the development of solar geoengineering technologies under the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.  
  
International political control over the development of contested, high-stakes technologies with planetary risks is not unprecedented. The international community has a rich history of international restrictions and moratoria over activities and technologies judged to be too dangerous or undesirable. This history demonstrates that international bans on the development of specific technologies do not limit legitimate research or stifle scientific innovation. In addition, an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering could include exceptions for less dangerous approaches, for example by allowing the use of localized surface albedo-related technologies that pose few cross-regional or global risks.  
  
In sum, an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering would be timely, feasible, and effective. It would inhibit further normalization and development of a risky and poorly understood set of technologies that seek to intentionally manage incoming sunlight at planetary scale. And it would do so without restricting legitimate climate research. Decarbonization of our economies is feasible if the right steps are taken. Solar geoengineering is not necessary. Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.  
  
Given the increasing normalization of solar geoengineering research, a strong political message to block these technologies is required. An International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering is needed now.

So that's what I'm doing here for solar geoengineering. For those who don't know, solar geoengineering is an array of proposed techniques to direct modify the Earth's albedo, reflecting more sunlight away from the atmosphere and therefore cooling it. It could be achieved by spreading reflective particles in the stratosphere, like certain sulfates, and would begin acting immediately. It wouldn't fix the problem - emissions would still need to be reduced, and carbon eventually removed through natural or artificial means - but it would extend the timescale.

I've read [serious proposals](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2851) by reputed environmental scientists that it is the only realistic way of achieving sub <1.5 °C warming within 2100. That same article pointed out that IPCC scenarios are currently assuming we use massive carbon capture far past what seems currently feasible. So solar geoengineering appears to be the only realistic solution.

3. Global warming is far from the only negative from releasing CO2 and other pollutants - most significantly, ocean acidification and air quality.

There's a lot to consider, I guess.  
  
Morally and ethically, do we have a right to intentionally tamper with the the whole world's atmosphere?  Geoengineering is a choice we aren't just making for ourselves, we're also making it for future generations; on its face that's a good intention, but DDT was thought to be a miracle insecticide, too.  
  
I also don't know how we'd get other nations on board with the idea, and if we go it alone, what kind of precedent does that set?  Even if we agree that the cause is just and the science is sound, we also have to acknowledge that there may be consequences for our actions.  
  
The question is still whether or not we have the right to geoengineer the planet on a massive scale, and whether everyone else will agree that we have that right, too.  
  
In terms of the actual science, again, it's a trade off.  When you pump sulfates into the air you get acid rain, when you spread reflective particles those particles have to fall back down to earth, they very well may slow or stop global warming, but the quantity necessary to the task is going to have other ecological consequences as well.  TANSTAAFL.  
  
Big ass mirrors orbital mirrors, on the other hand, that's something I could get on board with!  (Not economically feasible and the scale is far too large.)   
  
You're not an idiot.  Geoengineering might ultimately be the solution we turn to, from a political policy perspective it scares the shit out of me, from a historical perspective I find it hard not to think of asbestos insulation.  That's probably an emotional reaction on my part, but it's a reaction you're going to run into.",COMMENT

Here's GPT's summary of some risks from that article:

* **Altered Rainfall Patterns:** SAI-induced cooling may disrupt Earth's water cycle, leading to changed rainfall patterns, with poorly coordinated aerosol release causing extreme rainfall in some areas and droughts in others, impacting ecosystems and disease spread.
* **Exacerbation of Natural Catastrophes:** SAI could interact unpredictably with natural events like volcanic eruptions, potentially worsening their impacts and necessitating urgent adjustments to prevent overcooling and extreme weather patterns.
* **Termination Shock:** Disruption or termination of SAI systems could lead to a rapid, significant Earth heating within decades if the aerosol release, critical for ""hiding"" global warming, is suddenly halted for an extended period.
* **Space Weather and Solar Flares:** Unexpected solar activity, like solar flares, could damage the aviation and satellite systems essential for SAI, disrupting its effectiveness.
* **Cyberattacks:** SAI systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, and their compromise could lead to uncontrolled aerosol release, potentially causing environmental and geopolitical consequences.
* **Political Challenges and Governance:** Poor governance and political swings, influenced by vested interests like the fossil fuel industry, may result in disorganized SAI use.

sRM also wouldn't eliminate the need to eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Ghg emissions last in the environment for decades.  More concentration of ghg in the atmosphere would only compound the climate change problem even with some sort of geoengineering solution to offset the emissions.

Further, fossil fuels are a major source of air pollution which ultimately causes respiratory illnesses/death. There are clear safer alternatives to fossil fuels.

Scientists know that renewables do work and is feasible in fighting climate change. There is high probability that this approach will work so it's just a matter of accelerating implementation.

Why not turn a negative into a positive? Discharge hyper-saline brine from desalination plants into the canal. We’ll stick with the Suez because its the easy example. You could dump the brine into the canal somewhere along the midway point.

But the seasonal monsoons that hindered communist supply operations in Laos also hampered the interdiction effort. These efforts were hindered by morning fog and overcast, and by the smoke and haze produced by the slash-and-burn agriculture practiced by the indigenous population. During 1968 the USAF undertook two experimental operations that it hoped would worsen the monsoons. ""Project Popeye"" was an attempt to indefinitely extend the rainy season over southeastern Laos by cloud seeding. Testing on the project began in September above the Kong River watershed that ran through the Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound areas. Clouds were seeded by air with silver iodide smoke and then activated by launching a fuse fired from a flare pistol. Fifty-six tests were conducted by October; 85% were judged to be successful. President Johnson then gave authorization for the program, which lasted until July 1972.[10]: 226–228 

Testing on the second operation, ""Project Commando Lava"", began on 17 May: scientists from Dow Chemical had created a chemical concoction that, when mixed with rainwater, destabilized the soil and created mud. The program drew enthusiasm from its military and civilian participants, who claimed that they were there to ""make mud, not war."" In some areas it worked, depending on the makeup of the soil. The chemicals were dropped by C-130A aircraft, but the overall effect on North Vietnamese interdiction was minimal and the experiment was cancelled.[10]: 236–239

The moon can eclipse the Sun just barely.  In order to create an umbra region a shade at L1 needs to be 4 to 5 times as large as the moon.  Technically needs to be even bigger because the light pressure force.  The penumbra will still be spread out to half a degree.  Much more than Earth's radius.  If it is smaller than 15,000 km then you would see a transit.  Like a dot on the Sun.  People in the northern hemisphere will observe the transit as further south than viewers in Australia see.  At the equator the dot moves west to east over the course of the day.  

Don't take my word for it.  Look at a white wall with natural sunlight coming in.  Use something pointy like a pen or pencil.  Close to the wall the shadow is sharp.  Pull away and it blurs out.  Shadows cast by artificial light may get a variety of effects.  The Sun on Earth is half a degree wide.

Edit.  You can be extremely precise.  For example we could position a shade so that only people north of the arctic circle see the southernmost chunk of the Sun get partially eclipsed.  We could also position it so only sunrise or only sunset are effected.  In that case a partial eclipse at the west or east edge.  These tricks just mean that most of the shadow (penumbra) is cast into deep space.  No new technology needed but cost estimates need to be adjusted.  

The shade can also utilize window blind techniques. Block light at certain times and not others.  For example you could block out 24% of sunlight for an hour when it is noon in Hawaii.  Agriculture in Japan and California would not be effected much.  That gives Earth 1% shading.  You would need 24x the shade material to do that plus it has moving parts.

A circle with a radius equivalent to the moon’s is basically 9 million sq km.

1 sq km of solar panels gets you around 1 GW.  So, each moon’s worth of shade gets you 9 petawatts. If you wanted to completely shade the Earth, that gets you 36-45 petawatts. You don’t, of course, so cut that down by a reasonable fraction - while also acknowledging that you want it wider than just 4-5 moons.

I came upon here thanks to OCC on Youtube, and I have a question to ask.


Some time ago, I thought about the desert, and the rising sea levels, and I thought ""why not use one to limit the second,""

So my question is this : wouldn't it be possible to dig huge canals in the Sahara, that'd lead to basins, and then open it to the sea?

The rising levels would send water into the canals, and then the basins, basically negating any destructive effects. Plus, the water would irrigate the desert and help combat desertification by providing the resources needed to grow plants. In short creating a network of oasises.

Is it feasible, and what would be the negative effecrs it could have (we wouldn't want to accidentally interrupt the gulf stream I guess?)

Et ces tribus ne sont pas proto-socialistes comme je l'entends en permanence dans la bouche des gauchistes, c'est vraiment la version de Gauche du mythe du troc à droite. Ces sociétés sont des société claniques, dont tous les membres partagent des liens de sang. Expliquer qu'elles ne se payent pas entre elles et que c'est du communisme est tout aussi débile que d'expliquer qu'une famille moderne est communiste.Quand on regarde les interaction des ces tribus, donc de ces familles, entre elles, on remarque qu'elles ne sont PLUS DU TOUT des relations de partage sans contrepartie, mais plutôt des relation de """"""troc"""""" ou d'échanges de cadeau ritualisés, avec une attente que les cadeaux soient de valeurs équivalente, sous peine de créer des conflits, enfin ça c'est quand ils se génocident pas pour avoir ce qu'ils veulent.

**EDIT:** **El Classico je réponds et je bloque, si tu ne veux pas échanger avec moi n'écris pas une réponse que je ne peux pas consulter simplement pour faire illusion auprès des lecteurs.**

Et si tu savais lire je n'ai jamais dit que ces sociétés étaient de Gauche, exactement l'inverse en fait. C'est les gauchistes (Des gens de gauche complètement aveuglés par leur idéologie) qui veulent à tout prix voir dans ces sociétés un modèle Socialiste fonctionnel.Ça leur permet de justifier la théorie selon laquelle l'Homme est fondamentalement bon, altruiste, socialiste à l'origine et que c'est la révolution bourgeoise et le culte de l'argent qui a perverti les Hommes. Et donc si tout ca n'est qu'une construction sociale de l'immense complot bourgeois et un produit de la lutte des classes alors il suffit d'un petit peu de rééducation et de quelques purges pour se désendoctriner du Capitalisme et hop, grande internationale Socialiste.

Sauf que non, ce ne sont pas des modèles proto-socialistes pour les raisons que j'ai évoqué, et que ce contre quoi les Socialistes luttent c'est la nature humaine, ils créent donc systématiquement des sociétés profondément inhumaine et dont la brutalité va croissante au fur et à mesure qu'ils désespèrent de réussir à rééduquer la population.

>L'agriculture n'était pas une nécessité, c'était un accident.

L'agriculture était absolument une nécessité du développement des sociétés humaines au delà d'une certaine taille. La chasse et la cueillette sont des modes de vies confortable et beaucoup moins durs que le travail de la terre, mais les rendements sont extrêmement faibles et instables, ils demandent une grande occupation de la Terre ce qui amène à des conflits réguliers autour des territoires de chasse.

Sans travail humain de la Terre et optimisation des rendements il n'y a aucun moyen de nourrir 8 Milliards d’êtres humains. Même 1% de la population humaine ce serait déjà compliqué. Et ce rendement ""absolu"" est beaucoup plus stable que les sources de la chasse et de la cueillette qui génèrent plus de famines.

>Les nations sédentaires quoi.

Pitié, les nations sédentaires se font des guerres de territoires pour des raisons politiques et idéologiques, et non seulement elles peuvent arrêter à tout moment, mais elles le font et elles se portent encore mieux comme ça.

Dans les sociétés de chasseur-ceuilleur il n'y a pas de développement intensif, seulement du développement extensif. Toute croissance de la société passe par l'anéantissement des voisins, le massacre de leurs hommes et la réduction en esclavage sexuel de leurs femmes.  
La Guerre n'est pas quelque chose qui arrivent quand des leaders pètent les plombs, c'est une nécessité de la vie quotidienne pour garantir un approvisionnement en gibier.  
Mais bon je suppose que la brutalité des Comanches, Apaches et autres Lakota est la conséquence de leur sédentarisation .... /s

>Je ne parle pas de ton image d’Épinal à la Cannibal Holocaust avec ces tribus qui sacrifient les bébés et laissent crever leurs vieux, c'est d'une ignorance assez manifeste. 

Le Sénicide est une pratique qui est infiniment plus courante dans ces tribus que dans n'importe quelle société sédentarisée, et le fait pour un ancien qui n'est plus capable de contribuer à la tribu de se laisser mourir est considéré comme un geste noble de sacrifice. En période de tensions (famines, guerres, ...) c'est même un phénomène qui est très largement attendu des anciens.

Pour les jeunes je n'ai jamais dit qu'ils les tuaient, même si ça arrive, mais entre les environnements difficiles, les approvisionnement de nourriture incertains, les migrations épuisantes et les guerres fréquentes, ... la mortalité infantile est horriblement élevé. Il est pas rare d'avoir une classe d'age avec 50-70% de mortalité chez les Amérindiens par exemple lors de leur grande migrations pour suivre les bisons. Des semaines de marche, avec une nourriture rare, les mères qui ne peuvent pas produire assez de lait pour leurs enfants, ...

>beaucoup de ces jeunes se sont suicidé justement parce qu'ils avaient perdu leur mode de vie traditionnel.

Et? Ils ont grandi dans ce qui sous tous les aspects s'apparente à une secte, ils sont totalement inadaptés au monde moderne, ne savent pas communiquer, perdent tous leurs repères et passent d'un monde ou la communautés est toujours autour d'eux à un monde ou ils doivent se débrouiller seul. Oui, beaucoup tombent dans la drogue, l'alcool, se suicident, ... la transition est extrêmement difficile. Comme pour toute personne qui quitte une secte.

Mais:

1. Ça ne veut pas dire que le mode de vie de la secte est meilleur que le mode de vie occidental. Juste que la transition est difficile.
2. Malgré qu'ils connaissent les difficultés de cette transition, génération après génération, toujours plus de jeunes souhaitent tenter cette expérience, ce qui confirme bien qu'ils sont prêts à prendre ces risques pour s'intégrer dans une société civilisée et avoir accès au confort moderne.
3. Ceux qui ont fait cette transition et ont réussis à s'en sortir ne reviennent quasiment jamais en arrière et ne regrettent pas leurs choix.
4. La réponse des tribus face à cette évolution est de se retrancher encore plus dans leurs traditions, de couper tous les ponts avec ceux qui sont partis, de les traiter comme des pariahs, ... ce qui renforce encore plus la détresse des individus.

It is costly and trying to meddle with natural forces will have further consequences. Injecting aerosols in atmosphere and if anything goes wrong  then what, inject more chemicals?

On domestic scale we can do few things. It'll not be an instant major impact factor but it will correct the current anomalies slowly over time. We need to plant trees and strictly only native/endemic species of the locality. A non native species can hijack it's niche zone and become invasive, eg- latvinia, water hyacinth had been introduced and have proven to be extremely destructive to out native ecosystems. Miyawaki method of reforestation is one such solution and it can be applied on a small patch, as small as 1m². In agriculture sector we need to switch from monoculture to permaculture as much as possible. Domestic waste water should be treated with greywater treatment system(baffle) or wetland/bogwater filtration method before releasing it. Construction of swales to help surface water penetration. Construction of ponds, rainwater harvesting pits on slopes, step farming will also help. 

Precautions: Some methods suggested above are volatile in nature and should only be practiced/executed  after proper research. There are set of rules which need to be followed. If ignored it'll cause destruction than preventing it. Eg- Miyawaki method. In this method only native plants must be planted.

Yeah sure the drill bit might wear out more with auckland's underground, but making underground subway or above ground rail isnt rocket science.

Take that panmure roundabout for example. If it was up to me, I'd bulldoze every single shop in that panmure strip and start digging underground rail. That area isnt thriving anyway, might as well bulldoze everything and make it a proper connection hub between panmure to the rest of east auckland. Get that tunnel underneath the river and get it above ground in pakuranga building an above ground rail stretching to howick , then botany, then flat bush , otara, then down to papakura station maybe stopping by the botanic gardens too along the way. The bus line is an absolute waste of time. 

Trust me, a train ride is way better than a bus ride in terms of commute. It's efficient as it doesnt share roads and you dont stop ever few feet. You also get a more ""intimate or private"" feel in a train compared to busses. It just feels better.

&#x200B;

Thats how you get a city connected. From Kura you could take a train ride to botany shopping centre without a car.

Same with the north shore. Dig under, pop out the other side and get rail all the way to not just albany but whanga- freakin- paroa.

These machines cannot cut through hard basalt rock though which limits their wider use across the city. Alternative methods (often blasting) are required which are much more expensive and slow. The volcanic deposits across Auckland are also highly variable - you can be in and out of solid rock, loose rubbly gravel and even Peat. Again adding to cost.

Rail tunnels also need to be fairly flat meaning our undulating topography is not helpful. Would need some seriously deep stations in high elevation areas. This has its own challenges associated with blasting to remove volcanic rock and engineering to prevent settlements/damage to surrounding buildings and infrastructure from dewatering of deep station excavations.

At the end of the day, anything can be done but it comes at a price. Our low population density, variable and challenging ground conditions and hilly topography just makes it difficult for the numbers to add up a lot of the time.

but my opinion is this - based on this paper [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-022-06468-x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-022-06468-x)  that consensus of available models is 2.16C  for doubling CO2 (not transitional - so that 2.16C will be achieved in hundreds of years, transitional warming in 100 years probably in a range of 1.9C) and the fact, that energy generation likely peaked CO2 emissions and transport will peak at approx 2030 (peak oil consumption is projected for 2027) it will not be needed. if just current efforts continue - doubling will not be reached because full decarbonisation happens earlier.

So, at least there is no expectation of worst case scenarios. 

Then I assume, that Allam Cycle power generation (first such stations are built now, albeit not using pellets) using bio based feedstock (corn residue pellets, wood pellets) etc has a capability to remove no less that 10% of current emissions without much financial burden. So when almost all world transition to net zero happens by 2070 just with current level of effort  (still doubling of CO2 won't be achieved) and then 10% current emission levels carbon capture proceeds (via biomass with carbon capture at Allam Cycle thermal plants), the worst what could be suggested is peak of 1.8C by 2100 then slow decrease due to continued removal.

Because one of the suggested ways to deal with climate change is to fertilize the open ocean deserts with iron.


The open ocean, far from any coastline, is a type of desert, very few nutrients around.  Adding iron, shockingly little iron, causes large plankton blooms. And those attract ever larger sea life. 

And there was a paper showing something like 13% of fish poop, almost entirely carbon, sinks to the deep ocean, where it stays locked. 


Another option is biochar. It has been proven to help agricultural output in hot humid climates. And it's been proven to not hurt anything everywhere else.

The US spends million on agricultural subsidies. Instead of subsidizing corn ethanol, they could subsidize use of biochar. Could work to create some kind of carbon trading system, where farmers get paid for plowing biochar into their fields.

Lastly carbon fiber. Carbon fiber is used for very high end bicycle frames, racing car bodies and breaks, plane parts, etc.  It's very strong and very expensive and 100% carbon.

At it's current price we'll never use enough of it to make a difference. But just how Tesla made batteries and electric cars 10 times cheaper, so some day someone could make carbon fiber 10 or more times cheaper to manufacture.

Cheap carbon fiber could be used by the millions of tonnes, in construction and manufacturing, and roads and bridges, etc. That might be enough to reduce climate change.

  If you’ve seen the photographs, you’ll note that the cows are right up against each other (even though not penned). That’s staged or something else. They wouldn’t do that, when it’s hot. That would make them hotter. They literally only do that, when it’s freezing out or occasionally, when it’s storming and even then, it’s when they’re back out to pasture. 
  Which is also another thing: they wouldn’t be kept in a feed lot, on a hot day, long enough to overheat. They’d get returned to the pasture where there’s tons of trees and a couple of water features and they just hang out, in the shade. But like I said, I saw the story in Reuters but when I checked the local news and state news, no such story could be found. I even searched keywords cattle, cows, etc. .

  Not saying the heat isn’t abnormal. I’m sure you’re aware of the Lake Mead, situation.  But again. It’s all tied to the geomagnetic reversal and the approaching solar maximum. 

  Everyone keeps talking about the “affliction” but I remember I caught onto the magnetosphere issue, before I went into the hospital. I remember telling people before the lockdowns that in a couple of years, they won’t be able to hide the effects of the reversal anymore. The first people to seriously be effected would be farmers. 

   It’s a really long story but once you see it, it will all make sense. Once I saw it, I could see our trajectory. It’s the worst possible outcome and there’s absolutely nothing that can be done about it, except to dodge the authorities and live out your life, until the reversal. You’re not going to want to be near the coast or a subduction zone, in the near future. 

  I can pretty much interpolate a major catastrophe (seismic, meteorological, volcanological), within a few days based on historical data, cross referenced with the current LASCO coronagraph report on heliophysical activity (CME, solar forcing, plasma streams, etc.).

I've been reading about ""Solar Radiation Management"" which entails shooting phosphates into the ~~atmosphere~~ stratosphere to deflect solar radiation and prevent warming. People in the actual environmental movement are endorsing this stuff, especially in the West, when the risks are astronomically higher than the potential reward. The idea is basically to emulate the eruption of volcanos which tend to create a layer of permanent cloud cover that blocks sunlight. However, if you look at what happens during these eruptions, rain patterns change, crops die, and as always, the global south is disproportionately affected. Not to mention the fact that the second we stop doing it, we get hit with a wall of all of that pent up heat. Beyond that, we just don't know what could happen with this tech – the only way to test the global effects are to just do it. ""Environmentalists"" meet in fancy conference rooms to decide whether we should (best case scenario) sacrifice the global poors to make the world slightly more habitable for the global north for a short amount of time, or worse, plunge earth into perma-winter. 

People are so desperate to prop up extractive oil and gas industries and so hubristic in their supposed control of this rock that they really think they can engineer this massive complex array of intertwining systems to suit their needs. 

It's the same god complex that got us in this mess in the first place. We love thinking we are this all powerful steward of the planet that has full control and final say over the way this planet behaves. The fundamental narrative of the way our modern economy works is that we have dominion over this world – we can take, exploit and modify as we see fit. There will be repercussions for this behavior. As George Carlin once said, the earth can shake us off like a bad case of the fleas. 

We aren't getting anywhere until we take this planet seriously. It's not an object – It's a billion year old collection of deeply interconnected systems and defense mechanisms that has dealt with much worse than the likes of us before. We can decide whether we want to work alongside it and prosper, or fight it until the end and end up as nothing more than a footnote in the geological time scale.",GEO-ENGINEERING

h0fmle1,t3_nrb44p,Fins_FinsT,24,1,"> I've been reading about ""Solar Radiation Management"" which entails shooting phosphates into the atmosphere to deflect solar radiation and prevent warming.

Meanwhile, actual solar radiation decrease is already happening, for many decades, exactly by means of stratospheric particulates. Jet liners' exhaust soot is injected into lower stratosphere in massive amounts. Significant fraction of ground-level industrial particulate emissions end up convected / mixed up into stratosphere as well.

As a result, known physical phenomena which casually is known as ""global dimming"" - is actually already in place. 

Meeasurements were taken, all around the globe, to quantify the effect. In some areas downwing from China, sunlight is reduced by up to 21%. In much of Europe, sunlight is reduced by ~10...12%. Those are in compare to 1950s.

Extremely reliable methods were used to quantify it. One of methods used is pan evaporation rate, which measurements were being taken for several decades with utmost consistency, same equipment, every day, in many locations (for agricultural purposes). Other methods confirm the findings. It is undeniable.

This plays big role for agriculture, in particular. Crops are evolved to get 100% sunlight intensity, not <90%. When it's <90%, certain problems emerge - hardly noticeable, if at all, when you look at a single plant, but massively important in terms of global agricultural production levels, onset and scale of certain complications (rust, etc), and long-term ecological implications which in turn have the potential to degrade agricultural production much more.

The worst part is, this ""veil"" of particulates (which IPCC ""conviniently"" denies to quantify, giving the reason of them being unable to reliably estimate its effects), - this ""global dimming"" we humans have already created is short-lived: if, say, all the industrial and transportation particulates' emissions would stop today, then most of man-made globally dimming layer of stratospheric particulates would settle down back to surface in a matter of few years.

While most of greenhouse gases will remain in the air for decades (CH4), or centuries (CO2), or even much longer (certain CFCs' lifetime is well over 1000 years in the athmosphere).

This means, mankind is not ""going"" to do a ""technofix"" about it, even if not intentionally so. It's already doing it as a matter of fact, and this ""technofix"" already has clearly catastrophic consequence: when it'll stop (and it'll have to stop sooner or later) - sudden, fast, massive jump in surface temperatures is to happen. 

The higher GHG concentration is, and the more of global dimming (including, partly, intentional further on) is being done - the bigger, deadlier and faster eventual temperature increase will be.

P.S. One certain Lowell Wood (at least) once said in White House when discussing certain solar management methods 10+ years ago, already - ""we'll be riding the necks of our grandkids with this one, of course"".

1.) Its like the ice cube from futurama where they keep having to put an increasingly larger ice cube and the emissions will continue to climb. How our climate, ecology and environment take the change is anyone’s guess. However, considering that our economic system is essentially doomed to exhaust itself in many ways idk if we can keep doing SRM indefinitely and once we stop it will be worse than never having done it.

2.) Countries will not agree to SRM and countries like Bangladesh or India will want to initiate SRM asap and Russia will try to stall any effort. If SRM affects the hydrological cycles in specific regions we will see governments fuck with each other’s climates to wage war without having to send troops places. As a species we are either unable and/or unwilling to manage our own pollution and the other consequences of our technology. Our technology surpasses our ability to responsibly use it. Our leaders already mismanage everything under the sun, I dont trust them to mess the the environment even more than what they are already doing and somehow solve climate change. The other thing is a lack of coordination and a black swan event happening simultaneously may cause us to just overdo SRM leading to a temporary cooling period followed by a rapid warming. 

3.) It only solves for temperature increase if that, but it wont help the 6th mass extinction, ecological overshoot, declining energy resources and raw material availability, ocean acidification, biosphere collapse etc. People will think climate change was no big deal and will continue with the destructive way of life we are accustomed to, maybe even kicking it into overdrive since “mission accomplished”.

I do assume whether we like it or not SRM will happen inside the next 5-10 years. SRM is relatively cheap and doesnt require people give up much so politicians will push these plans as easy peasy solutions. What worries me is that countries will start playing with the weather independently of one another and ignoring the consequences of intervention and we will only change the climate even more rapidly and violently leading to all kinds of unforeseen outcomes.

SPICE, and large-scale atmospheric geoengineering in general, aren't like that.

uodyaq,The Long-Term Outcome of Geo-Engineering,BornAgainSpecial,21,10,">In 2009, a correspondent asked me whether I thought nuclear weapons were the most dangerous aspect of modern technology. What follows is my reply, heavily rewritten. The most dangerous aspect of modern technology probably is not nuclear weapons. It could plausibly be argued that the remedies for global warming that are likely to be adopted constitute the most dangerous aspect of modern technology.  
>  
>Nations have a strong incentive to avoid using nuclear weapons, at least on any large scale, because such use would probably be suicidal. This doesn’t mean that nuclear war can never happen. On the contrary, the risk of it is very real. But a major nuclear war at least is not a strong probability for the foreseeable future.  
>  
>On the other hand, it is virtually certain that nations will fail to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide sufficiently and in time to prevent global warming from becoming disastrous. Instead, global warming will be kept in check through “geo-engineering.” This means that the Earth’s climate will be artificially managed to keep it within acceptable limits. Of the many tools that have been proposed for management of the Earth’s climate, three examples may be mentioned here:  
>  
>1. Powdered iron can be dumped into the oceans to stimulate the growth of plankton that will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  
>  
>2. Microbes or other organisms may be genetically engineered to consume atmospheric carbon dioxide.  
>  
>3. Carbon dioxide may be pumped into underground reservoirs for permanent storage there.  
>  
>Any attempt at geo-engineering will entail a grave risk of immediate catastrophe. “Geo-engineering makes the problem of ballistic-missile defense look easy. It has to work the first time, and just right.” Novel technological solutions usually have to be corrected repeatedly through trial and error; rarely do they work “the first time, and just right,” and that’s why people “quite rightly see \[geo-engineering\] as a scary thing.”  
>  
>But let’s assume that geo-engineering does work the first time and just right. Even so, there is every reason to expect that the longer-term consequences will be catastrophic.  
>  
>First: Attempts to meddle with the environment almost always have unforeseen, undesirable consequences. In order to correct the undesirable consequences, further meddling with the environment is required. This in turn has other unforeseen consequences ... and so forth. In trying to solve our problems by tinkering with the environment we just get ourselves deeper and deeper into trouble.  
>  
>Second: For hundreds of millions of years, natural processes have kept the Earth’s climate and the composition of its atmosphere within limits that have allowed the survival and evolution of complex forms of life. Sometimes during this period the climate has varied enough to cause the extinction of numerous species, but it has not become so extreme as to wipe out all of the most complex organisms. When human beings have taken over the management of the Earth’s climate, the natural processes that have kept the climate within livable limits will lose their capacity to perform that function. The climate will then be entirely dependent on human management. Since the Earth’s climate is a worldwide phenomenon, it cannot be managed by independent local groups; its management will have to be organized on a worldwide basis and therefore will require rapid, worldwide communication. For this reason among others, management of the Earth’s climate will be dependent on technological civilization. Every past civilization has broken down eventually, and modern technological civilization likewise will break down sooner or later. When that happens, the system of human climate-management necessarily will break down too. Because the natural processes that kept the climate within certain limits will be defunct, the Earth’s climate can be expected to go haywire. In all probability the Earth will become too hot or too cold for the survival of complex life-forms, or the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere will sink too low, or the atmosphere will become contaminated with toxic gasses, or some other atmospheric disaster will occur.  
>  
>Third: When the Earth has a managed climate, maintenance of the technological system will be considered essential for survival because, as has just been pointed out, the breakdown of the technological system will probably lead to radical and fatal disruption of the climate. The elimination of the technological system, through revolution or by any other means, would be almost equivalent to suicide. Because the system will be seen as indispensable for survival, it will be virtually immune to challenge. The elite of our society-the scientists and engineers, the corporation executives, the government officials and the politicians-are afraid of nuclear war because it would lead to their own destruction. But they will be delighted to see the system that gives them their power and their status become indispensable and therefore immune to any serious challenge. Consequently, while they will make every effort to avoid nuclear war, they will be quite pleased to undertake management of the Earth’s climate.",GEO-ENGINEERING

i8enee5,t3_uodyaq,GruntBlender,4,1,"Sure, geo engineering is extremely dangerous, serving only to doing nothing. We already meddled with the climate by dumping unfathomable amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into it. We have a good idea of what that will do, and it's not pretty. 

I don't accept the premise that artificial influence will shut down natural processes that regulate climate. The recent few thousand years have been unusually stable, which allowed for civilisation to flourish. As that period of stability comes to an end, even without the massive pollution we've been doing, artificial climate management would become necessary for business-as-usual. As if stands tho, the damage we've done to the climate is causing a mass extinction and rapid changes the world is unprepared for. We have to do something. 

Lastly, the author mentions carbon capture as some arcane technique with unknown consequences, as if we haven't been dumping gigatons of the stuff into the air. What it would do is directly undo the changes we made to the atmosphere, it's the least damaging option, less so than even going carbon zero.",COMMENT

It is a fact that the composition which make up the material that is being sprayed in the skies in order to reflect sun rays back into the  stratosphere is highly toxic, It is interesting to know - do they also spray the skies above areas/regions where the powerful and the wealthy (high positioned politicians, royalty and Billionaires) are living? are also regions where stately country homes of royalty and aristocracy are affected ? or is it only polluting the rest of society ?

Any clue?",GEO-ENGINEERING

You can't, because there has never been replicative testing done to disprove the data we have. They (the EPA or any other environmental agency of any kind) cannot and will not find what they're instructed not to look for.

We have primary data in many forms, including but certainly not limited to electron microscopy of samples taken at altitude through a confluent layer of chemtrails showing heavy metal nanoparticulates that perfectly match the size and composition of geoengineering patents going back many decades. This and so, so, so much more - It is truly irrefutable.

8wke3g,We're NatGeo engineers designing all kinds of cameras—even ones that can attach to sharks and penguins. Ask us anything!,nationalgeographic,9308,489,"EDIT: That's all folks! Thanks so much for your time and questions! I (Tom OBrien) can be found on Instagram @mechanicalphoto. There I blog about my work and my adventures!
Hi, we’re both engineers at National Geographic’s imaging lab!

I’m Kyler Abernathy (pictured left), the Director of Research, Exploration Technology. I collaborate with scientists worldwide supporting wildlife research with the use of specialized cameras, like Crittercams that can be worn by all kinds of animals—on land and underwater—collecting video to learn about the hidden parts of animals' lives. Footage from Crittercams deployed on emperor penguins appeared in “March of the Penguins.”
 
And I’m Tom O’Brien (pictured right), the Photo Engineer (a mechanical engineer) working for National Geographic Magazine. I design and build custom photography equipment, such as camera traps and robotic camera systems, for National Geographic photographers of all types (portraiture, underwater, adventure, etc.) all over the world. Sometimes I get requests for typical camera gear that’s needed in XYZ country in 3 days, and other times, I have to fabricate the custom equipment myself. Follow me on instagram @Mehcanicalphoto for more insights to what I do and what we get up to in the basement.
 
We’ve both been tinkering away in the imaging lab at the National Geographic headquarters for a combined total of 20 years. Ask us anything!

* Re-routing rivers/lakes to water food fields 
* Creating dams to control water flows
* Creating drydock area's on the ocean for building
* Creating artificial lakes/ponds for water sourcing

His ***weapon*** turns Geo Yellow during his auto chain at hit number ***1, 4, 5, charged attack***

* Under elemental vision: weapons are observed as grey if the wielder does physical damage, and will turn the color of corresponding element if the autos are doing elemental damage
   * Diluc's weapon is grey before ulting, and red after ulting, Keqing's weapon is grey before casting E, and purple after casting E
* Zhongli's weapon turns Geo Yellow (identical to Ningguang and Noelle's autos after Q) at hit **1, 4, 5** in his auto chain, and his **charged attack**

To clarify people who are confused that the gold weapon may have been an animation effect as opposed to actual Geo Damage, the Uploader did further testing in Video 2.

&#x200B;

**Test 1: Zhongli's 1,4,5 and charge attack is the same category as Tartaglia's E (melee form) autos, which is elemental (hydro) damage**

* Setup: Go to Settings > Graphics > Co-Op Teammates Effects > Off
* When you use elemental vision to observe your teammate Tartaglia perform melee autoattacks under this setup, the **hydro elemental** **daggers will not appear on your screen**
* This effect is shared with Zhongli, but his weapon only disappears on attacks **1, 4, 5 and charged attacks**

**Conjecture 1:** Zhongli's autos on hit 1,4,5 and charged attacks are of the same nature as Tartaglia's melee autos, they do elemental damage.

&#x200B;

**Test 2: Zhongli's Autos Under Chongyun E Cast**

* Setup: Cast Chongyun E, and observe under elemental vision the **weapon color and trajectory of weapon color**
* Test Subject 1: Diluc
   * No ult: Weapon is Cryo light blue, with weapon trajectory as cyro light blue
   * Post Ult: Weapon is Pyro Red, weapon trajectory is Pyro Red => pyro damage is dealt
* Test Subject 2: Keqing
   * Pre E Cast: Weapon is Cryo light blue, weapon trajectory cyro light blue
   * Post E Cast: Weapon is Cryo light blue, weapon trajectory cyro light blue, Chongyun has elemental override => cyro damage is dealt
* Test Subject 3: Zhongli
   * Weapon is Geo Gold on attacks 1,4,5 and charge attack, weapon is cyro light blue on 2,3,6
   * Trajectory is cyro light blue for all above mentioned attacks, doing cyro damage

**Conjecture 2**:  Zhongli was supposed to do Geo damage 1,4,5 and charged attack, overriding Chongyun E effect, which is why the weapon is still Geo Gold, but since the damage type was not actually implemented on live, the trajectory is cryo blue , doing cryo damage

&#x200B;

**TLDR (Conclusion):** Observing the animation of Zhongli has currently on live (ver 1.1), Zhongli was meant to do hybrid physical and Geo damage on his autos, which would agree with his previous iteration of ult that granted 7s petrification and Geo + physical resist debuff on targets.

Hopefully this will shed some light to those who are closely following Zhongli's changes in Beta 1.3 testing, and point to some changes they would like to see implemented post 1.3

* Geo-engineering will end up causing some major unintended consequences up to and including extinction of mankind.
* Geo-engineering will end up being a cheap and effective way to easily undo the vast majority of climate change with manageable side-effects.

Given these, I think the right answer is to wait until things get desperate.  This has two main advantages:

* We're not taking an unnecessary risk with the fate of humanity by trying to implement an global experiment on the climate that may be avoidable.  If, for example, carbon recapture (which plenty of people are working on) takes off (which is technically considered a type of geo-engineering, but certainly not any more geo-engineering than the action of pumping carbon into the atmosphere in the first place) and becomes cheap, practical, and scalable, we wouldn't really have to resort to anything risky.
* It gives us more time to come up with more technologies, more research on existing techniques, and more time to come up with more techniques.  All of which means that the eventual experiment, if we're forced to do it, will be less risky.

jk4vbr,Collapse & Geo-engineering policy ideas,JoeSalmonGreen,7,4,"There are two policy proposals I’d like to make to the next possible conference. The first is on re-gearing the Party in recognition of the fact we’re likely to encounter a catastrophic breakdown in the Earth’s ecosystems in the next 2-3 years, and the second that we should now begin to embrace geoengineering as the only way to ensure the planet is capable of supporting human life in the long term. I’m no expert on either topic, and wondered if anybody else has contacted you about similar ideas who I could work with?

**Policy 1 - Acknowledging the Imminent Collapse of our Ecosystems**

Before The Green Party gets the chance to contest another General Election in this country we will almost certainly have experienced a Blue Ocean Event, leading to catastrophic climate change and multiple environmental disasters. In the course of these events it is likely the UK as a nation state will cease to exist (at least as we now understand it). Communities are likely to be faced with food water shortages, water shortages and difficulty accessing medical care and electricity along with either an influx of refugee populations and / or a need to vacate their homes and communities.
As such we need to radically readjust our organisation to prepare for such circumstances, adopting new aims, strategies, tactics and messaging. We must be the driving force, as individuals and an organisation, behind adapting our communities to survive the oncoming consequences of catastrophic climate change, while continuing to also campaign to prevent further disruption and destruction of the Earth’s ecosystems. As such this motion proposes the following actions:

 * 1: Elected officials and local party officers must concentrate on making sure regions are as close as possible to being self sustaining in the production of food & water.
 * 2: Elected officials and local party officers must prepare regions to deal with influxes of refugee populations from parts of the country made uninhabitable by environmental disaster.
 * 3: Elected officials and local party officers must prepare the local population for evacuation in case of an environmental disaster.
 * 4: The Campaigns Committee should organise campaigns to push for the government to stockpile food and medicine as well as make sure our public services and utilities are as decentralised as possible and able to function without centralised leadership.
 * 5: Our membership team should switch our focus on recruiting and training members to help campaign in local and national elections, and instead focus on upskilling our membership in relevant post collapse skills.
 * 6: The Associate of Green Councillors should focus on supporting members in championing locally relevant projects geared towards surviving the breakdown of society and our ecosystems, such as indoor farming and local power generation.

**Policy 2 - Recognising the Unfortunate Importance of Geo-Engineering**

Climate change is now an unavoidable reality for the planet. It will not be possible, even with the cessation of all CO2 production at this moment for the Earth’s ecosystems not to be radically altered in a way that is no longer conducive to supporting human life in the long term. As such embracing and understanding geoengineering is the only way humans and potentially any intelligent life will survive on our planet. However our current understanding of the Earth's ecosystems and how to manage them is non-existent in any practical sense. As such this motion proposes the following actions:

 * 1: The Campaigns Committee should organise a campaign to push for a rapid increase in funding for geoengineering.",GEO-ENGINEERING

The IPCC and the policymakers and governments around the world have left it too long, and climate catastrophe is now upon us. 

Slashing fossil fuels, and deploying and scaling Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is absolutely necessary, but no longer sufficient to avoid climate catastrophe. 

It is now imperative that we add SRM at scale to our climate mitigation toolkit. 

The paper refers to SRM as climate cooling interventions, or just interventions, but really it is referring to what many people call Solar Radiation Management.

We simply have no other choice. 

We either perish on this planet from abrupt climate system mayhem, or study the heck out of and throw vast amounts of money into scientifically assessing and then deploying all the possible SRM ideas in order to preserve human society on this planet. 

We have no other options, at this stage. Climate change warming and disruption is accelerating “like a bat out of hell”.

However, many professionals, including oncologists and dermatologists, state that exposure to sun rays leads to a higher risk of tumors, thus mortality, and the above studies just compare two bad habits and thus have no academic value.

jsnpo3x,t3_15432my,Berkamin,105,11,"According to Dr. Seheult from MedCram continuing medical education, various studies have shown that increased sun exposure *reduces* mortality. See the lecture linked below.

Sun exposure apparently does a lot more than produce vitamin D. see this:

# MedCram | [Light as Medicine: Vitamin D isn't enough](https://youtu.be/5YV_iKnzDRg)

**EDIT** the study that found that increased sun exposure was counterintuitively associated with lower mortality was this:

# Journal of Internal Medicine | [Avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor for all-cause mortality: results from the Melanoma in Southern Sweden cohort](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.12251)

Quote of the abstract:

>**Background**  
>  
>Sunlight exposure and fair skin are major determinants of human vitamin D production, but they are also risk factors for cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). There is epidemiological evidence that all-cause mortality is related to low vitamin D levels.  
>  
>**Methods**  
>  
>We assessed the avoidance of sun exposure as a risk factor for all-cause mortality for 29 518 Swedish women in a prospective 20-year follow-up of the Melanoma in Southern Sweden (MISS) cohort. Women were recruited from 1990 to 1992 and were aged 25 to 64 years at the start of the study. We obtained detailed information at baseline on their sun exposure habits and potential confounders. Multivariable flexible parametric survival analysis was applied to the data.  
>  
>**Results**  
>  
>There were 2545 deaths amongst the 29 518 women who responded to the initial questionnaire. **We found that all-cause mortality was inversely related to sun exposure habits. The mortality rate amongst avoiders of sun exposure was approximately twofold higher compared with the highest sun exposure group, resulting in excess mortality with a population attributable risk of 3%.**  
>  
>**Conclusion**  
>  
>**The results of this study provide observational evidence that avoiding sun exposure is a risk factor for all-cause mortality.** Following sun exposure advice that is very restrictive in countries with low solar intensity might in fact be harmful to women's health.  


**/EDIT**

Vitamin D production is stimulated by UV-B light, but apparently red light, and near infrared light stimulates mitochondrial melatonin. Within the mitochondria melatonin is a potent antioxidant. It doesn't behave the same way as blood plasma melatonin, cannot be increased by supplementation,and is really important for protecting the mitochondria from oxidative damage.

Sunlight also appears to interact with chlorophyll from our diet that ends up in our bloodstream. Blood plasma chlorophyll was found to regenerate co-enzyme Q-10 (ubiquinol /ubiquinone in oxidized form) when exposed to light. Just reasoning from what we know about the function of CoQ10 this effect is suspected to have health benefits.

# Photochemistry and Photobiology | [Dietary Chlorophyll Metabolites Catalyze the Photoreduction of Plasma Ubiquinone](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01230.x)

Chlorophyll has other surprising effects in mammalian cells as well:

# Journal of Cell Science | [Light-harvesting chlorophyll pigments enable mammalian mitochondria to capture photonic energy and produce ATP](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/127/2/388/54610/Light-harvesting-chlorophyll-pigments-enable)

All of these effects factor into whether more sun exposure increases or decreases mortality. It is not merely a matter of cancer.

jsqfb1s,t3_15432my,forerofore,5,0,"the problem, OP, is that you are thinking of melanoma only...

you have to include squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma too.

by far the most common cancer in humans is skin cancer, due to sun exposure, and squamous cell carcinoma is much more frequent than melanoma, so you have to include every skin cancer which has its risk increased by sun exposure.

you also need to eliminate confusion bias and mortality due to other causes plus control for patients who received treatment vs patients who didn't.

another source of bias would be that outdoor exposure will lead to more exercise increasing physical fitness + the whole vitamin D theory, reducing mortality from other causes. exercise NEEDS to be ruled out as the cause of the reduced incidence of other tumors.

any stage 4 tumor (except a few leukemias that do very well on chemo) is a death sentence so oncologists actually study survival at 1 - 5 years instead of mortality (close to 100%) for some tumors. that being said, most skin cancers can be easily identified and removed before anything dangerous happens.

This may be a little heavier topic than what is usually here, but I think it is important for Tucsonans to be aware of what is happening in their city.

ek8zxb8,t3_ba4ank,PizzaSlayer5000,7,2,">  We plan to use a high-altitude balloon to lift an instrument package approximately 20 km into the atmosphere. Once it is in place, a very small amount of material (100 g to 1 kg) will be released ... Initially, we may release ice (frozen water) to make sure the instrumentation works properly. Later, we plan to release calcium carbonate, a common mineral dust. We may also release other materials such as sulfates in response to evolving scientific interests ... The test will pose no significant hazard to people or the environment. Calcium carbonate is a nontoxic chemical commonly found in nature, for example as limestone, and sub-micron precipitated calcium carbonate particles like the ones we will use are a common additive to consumer products such as paper and toothpaste ... Additionally, if we test sulfate in this experiment, the amount we would use would be less than the amount released during a one minute of flight of a typical commercial aircraft. Aircraft release sulfates due to residual sulfur content of aviation fuel.

I'm not at all worried about this piece of the experiment.  I might become concerned if they realize the project doesn't effectively scale up and the only way to get enough particles in the atmosphere to effect enough cooling to counteract climat change is by triggering major volcanoes everywhere or something like that.

11k98k2,Could Reflecting the Sun Away From Earth Reduce Global Warming? What to Know About Solar Radiation Management,giuliomagnifico,2,1,,SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT
jb9gss3,t3_11k98k2,Skyheadlins,1,0,"Reflecting the sun away from Earth, also known as solar radiation management (SRM), is a proposed geoengineering solution to reduce the effects of global warming. The idea is to reflect a portion of the sun's incoming radiation back into space, reducing the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, which would lead to a cooling effect.  
  
There are several proposed methods for SRM, including:  
  
1)Stratospheric aerosol injection: This involves injecting reflective particles, such as sulfur dioxide, into the upper atmosphere to reflect some of the sun's radiation back into space.  
  
2)Space-based reflectors: These are mirrors or other reflective surfaces placed in space to reflect the sun's radiation away from Earth.  
  
3)Marine cloud brightening: This involves spraying saltwater mist into low-lying marine clouds to make them more reflective and increase the amount of sunlight they reflect back into space.  
  
While SRM has the potential to reduce global temperatures and offset some of the effects of climate change, there are also concerns about its potential side effects and unintended consequences. These include:  
  
1)Regional climate effects: SRM could have different effects on different regions of the world, leading to uneven cooling and potentially disrupting weather patterns.  
  
2)Stratospheric ozone depletion: The use of sulfur dioxide for stratospheric aerosol injection could lead to the depletion of the ozone layer, which could have severe consequences for the Earth's climate and ecosystems.  
  
3)Political and social issues: The deployment of SRM could create geopolitical tensions and social issues, as different countries may have different opinions on the use of geoengineering solutions.  
  
Overall, while SRM is an area of ongoing research, it is not yet a widely accepted solution to climate change. Instead, many experts recommend focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through efforts such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable land use practices.",COMMENT

lxcbf4,Scientists in Iceland say ‘strong signs’ volcanic eruption is imminent - Will this be an organic Solar Radiation Management (SRM)?,plowsplaguespetrol,62,41,"SS: A few days ago, we discussed the plans by a Harvard University group to perform the first atmospheric tests of their SRM methodology. The pending volcanic event reported in this piece of news would likely perform the same test on a much larger scale. But more likely the ash and projectiles from this eruption, if any, would not reach the stratosphere.

The second article below sounds more concerning.


Scientists in Iceland say ‘strong signs’ volcanic eruption is imminent

Scientists in Iceland say ‘strong signs’ volcanic eruption is imminent
Several days of tremors near Mount Keilir indicate it is ‘more likely than not’ an eruption is about to begin.



Excerpts:

Víðir Reynisson of the island’s civil defence force told a mid-afternoon news conference it was “more likely than not” that an eruption – the first in the area since the 12th century – was about to begin, and could happen within the next few hours.

But Víðir said there was “no disaster going on and everyone can get on with their daily lives”. There was no immediate danger, he said, although people should avoid travelling to the area on the Reykjanes peninsula.

Thousands of tremors measuring up to 5 on the Richter scale have been recorded on the peninsula during the past week. Freysteinn Sigmundsson, a geophysicist, said that if it came, the eruption could also be delayed by several days.

If magma reaches the surface, Freysteinn said, it is unlikely to be in the form of an explosion of lava and ash shooting into the sky, but rather what is known as a fissure eruption, in which lava emerges more slowly from a crack in the earth’s surface.

That means there is unlikely to be a repeat of the chaos in 2010 when the six-day explosive eruption of the more southerly Eyjafjallajökull volcano caused huge disruption to international air travel, affecting as many as 10 million travellers.

Awakening volcanic region in Iceland 'could cause disruption for centuries'

Kate Ravilious
April 10, 2020

Reykjanes peninsula’s last active period started in 10th century and lasted 300 years

Excerpts:


Volcanic activity is escalating in a region of Iceland that has not erupted for 800 years, with scientists warning it could cause disruption for centuries to come.

Since 21 January, the Reykjanes peninsula south-west of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, has experienced more than 8,000 earthquakes and about 10cm of land uplift due to magma intrusions underground.

“It seems that after being relatively inactive for many centuries, this region is waking up,” said Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University.",SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT

>In the case of Mount Pinatubo, the result was a measurable cooling of the Earth’s surface for a period of **almost two years**  

Pibnatubo was the biggest eruption since about 1912 (Alaska).  Unless we get something like the Taupo mega eruption, things won't change much at all

mxpq7i,Looking for help understanding mass drivers for a targeted solar radiation management project,PlannMann,3,13,"HI!

First, let me apologize, I struggle when trying to communicate with people so please be patient with me.

I am working on an idea for solar radiation management, specifically blocking sunlight in space before it gets to the earth. This is a theoretical idea and I am trying to get some basic information before investing more into the project. Sadly, my abusive public school education discouraged math skills and I am not able to find math simple enough for mass drivers for me to understand. Or it is so simple it is also incomplete :(

I am trying to figure out the amount of energy needed for a mass driver in zero atmospheres to project a 1oz and 1lb amount of material from the moon, around the earth (approximately orbit of the moon but slightly closer) and land back on the moon. I would also like to know the size of the mass driver needed. (specifically how long the mass driver needs to be).

The reason for 2 weights of objects is that I need to have some idea of how mass drivers scale. 

Any help would be appreciated,

Thank you!",SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT

Joules are a unit of energy. Watts are a unit of power, or energy per second. Throwing one football is going to be in units of Joules, and throwing one football per second is going to be in units of Watts.

KE = 0.5 * 0.42 kg * 1,000 m/s^2

KE = 210,000 J.

Alternatively, throwing one football per second at 1 km/s is going to cost at least 210,000 W and two footballs per second is going to cost 420,000 W.

Plotting where your footballs go after that is more complicated but I know enough to know it's not really 1 km/s. Also, are we catching them in orbit around Earth and using the materials to build a sunshade or blocking sunlight with a continuous stream of footballs?",COMMENT

11.2km/s is earth's escape velocity, not the moon's.  The moon's escape velocity is 2.38 km/s.  If you are already orbiting the moon, it means you are already going about 1km/s, so you need an additional 1.38km/s to escape it.

> 13.2 * 210,000 is 2,772,000 watts to project 15 oz per second, the weight of a football. A TerraPower metal-cooled nuclear reactor would produce ~345 megawatts.

The unit of watts is joules / second, 13.2 km/s \* 210,000 Joules would give you the unit of joules-km/s.  That's not a unit of anything.  Since this unit is wrong, I am not really sure what you are trying to calculate in the rest of your comment.

Also, I suggest you stop using units like football to calculate things.  While it's comical, it makes the calculations really messy.  Stick with the metric system, use kg.  All the physics equations are designed to use those units.",COMMENT

mxweya,Looking for help understanding the area needed for targeted space-based solar radiation management from a sunshade near earth,PlannMann,7,21,"Hello,

First, let me apologize, I struggle when trying to communicate with people so please be patient with me. 

Space-based solar radiation management is traditionally thought of as giant mirrors at the L1 waypoint between the earth and the sun. I have an idea for a targeted effect on the earth that is far smaller but I am not sure how to calculate the surface area needed.

The idea is for a targeted effect over the earth orbiting at \~ the moon's orbit, or slightly closer (maybe 50K). The problem is I don't know how to calculate the area needed. 

For simplicity (trust me it's needed with this idea), let's assume I am trying to block 5% of light over a 10km by 10km area. Is there anyone who can help me calculate the area needed for a space-based object to block that much light at the moon's orbit from the earth?

I know it's a weird request with limited information but I am trying to not confuse people with details that don't actually help. I am hoping to write a long post on the idea in the next few months as I flush information out.",SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT
gvzoigf,t3_mxweya,Nethan2000,2,1,"You should be able to calculate it using Thales's Theorem. Let's assume that the sun is a flat disk with the diameter of x=1'390'000 km at the distance a=150'000'000 km, your sunshade is likewise a disk with the diameter of y and the distance of b=50'000 km and the shaded area is circular with the diameter of z=10 km.

Let's lead a line from the top of the sun's disk to the top of the shaded area and from the bottom of the sun to the bottom of the shaded area. The lines intersect at the distance of c below the ground. Since the sun, the shade and the shaded area are parallel, then according to Thales's Theorem, following values are equal:

(a+c)/x = c/z, therefore

az+cz = cx

cx-cz = az

c(x-z) = az

c = (az)/(x-z) ~= 1079 km

Now we know where the lines intersect and we can complete the triangles. Again, according to Thales's Theorem:

z/c = y/(b+c)

y = z(b+c)/c ~= 473 km

This should be the diameter of you sunshade if you want it to fully shade your intended area. If you want to just block 5% of sunlight, you can just take 5% of the area, which I'll let you calculate yourself.

If I made any errors, please correct me. The calculations might be more accurate with a spreadsheet - I used a pencil, a piece of paper and a calculator.

EDIT: I did it again in Excel with more accurate figures and came up with 415.9 km. Eh, good enough.

The shade will create a track related to the path followed by a Lunar eclipse.  The area on Earth that would see a full Lunar eclipse will see your 5% shade block 5% of some part of the Sun.  

Come Canadians saw 80% of the Sun eclipse in 2017 and some Mexicans saw 60%.  If people in Caspar Wyoming see your thing transit through the middle of the moon then people in Mexico see the thing skim the edge of the moon.  A few Canadians also get a full 5% drop in sunlight but it will be dimmed for less time than it gets dimmed in Wyoming.  The shade moves across the sky at the same pace in Wyoming or Saskatchewan but a chord across a circle is shorter than a diameter. 

Your 5% shade can be like a solid circle, any other solid shape, like a colander, or perhaps an SFIA logo.

Hei [r/norge](https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/),

Kunne  du tenke deg å gjennomføre en spørreundersøkelse og bli med i  trekningen av et Bose QuietComfort 35 II trådløse hodetelefoner? Tre  slike headsett loddes ut blant de som fullfører undersøkelsen.

Vi (universitetet i Bergen) trenger deltagere til en spørreundersøkelse om strålingsmanipulering.

Dette er en 'geo-engineering' teknologi som på engelsk kalles 'Solar Radiation Management'.

Strålingsmanipulering  er foreslått for å begrense global oppvarming. Vi er interessert i dine  meninger om denne teknologien og bruken den er foreslått for. Det  spiller ingen rolle om du ikke kjenner til strålingsmanipulering, du vil  få informasjon om hva det er i spørreundersøkelsen. Gjennomsnittlig tidsbruk  for å gjennomføre undersøkelsen er ca 25 minutter.

Hvis du er over 18 år, bor i Norge og IKKE student kan du gå inn på denne linken for å delta:

188btnw,Sources for cosmic and solar radiation,Unlimited2602,2,1,"Hello,
Before I start I want to make it clear that I am not looking for someone to do my work for me but instead I am looking for only guidance and suggestion.

I have a project going on for my diploma where I am studying the radiation that comes from the sun and from outside of our solar system and its potential effect on astronauts travelling between planets. Where could I find sources or something i can read and learn from about the ways that the rays, both ionizing and non-ionizing from the sun and our galaxy, can be stopped or prevented.
I want to note that I am not that deep into actual physics but I can read scientific documents and measurements.

Any help would be gladly appreciated!",SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT
kbmuwgr,t3_188btnw,Physics_Cat,2,0,"Hello, I'm a satellite designer with a specialization in radiation effects, so this seems right up my alley as something that I can help you with. 

The first step will be defining the radiation environment for the system of interest. The best tool that you'll be able to find is [CREME96](https://creme.isde.vanderbilt.edu/) which is the industry-standard tool for actual satellite designers and mission planners, and has the added bonus of being free. You can use CREME96 to define the radiation environment from the sun (Solar Energetic Particles or SEPs) as well as outside of the solar system (Galactic Cosmic Rays or GCRs). It can also predict trapped radiation belts in geomagnetic fields if your system is very close to the earth or other planets. 

From there, you'll need to model the transport of the radiation as it passes through the system structure. You may be interested in three types of particles: electrons, photons, and charged ions (i.e. nuclei including protons). 

1. For electrons, you can either use accurate modeling tools like CEPXS ([here's how to request a copy](https://rsicc.ornl.gov/PackageDetail.aspx?p=CEPXS&id=C00837&cpu=MNYCP&v=00&t=Coupled%20Electron-Photon%20Cross%20Section)) or you can use the Continuously Slowing Down Approximation (CSDA) with the assistance of an online tool like [ESTAR](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Star/Text/ESTAR.html).
2. For photons, I would recommend either CEPXS again or simple 1-D hand calculations using tabulated [Mass Attenuation Coefficients.](https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients) 
3. For ions, I would recommend using a tool like Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM, [here's a link](http://www.srim.org/)) or just doing less accurate 1-D hand calcs using the [Bethe-Bloch equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethe_formula).

jtl6oyl,t3_15ag56a,AbrahamLemon,27,2,"Answer: I work on a carbon capture technology. The idea of carbon capture gets a lot of interest, and a lot of funding, because it answers the desire for a technology that will allow us to operate with business as usual, without changing much. That's a pipe dream. There are a lot of groups that exist in the space that look outwardly like con artists, and they probably are. Groups are trying to monetize existing pieces of the carbon cycle and just get paid for it. There are other technologies, like direct air capture, didn't make really big promises but the technology is very far away. Some early Explorations have shown that they are a lot more limited then the people raising money would suggest. There are also a lot of Technologies that I don't think have fully evaluated the potential environmental impacts of what they're projecting. 

Far and away the most important thing we can do is reduce emissions. If we do not do that, there is nothing else that we can do to absorb emitted carbon. However, there are a lot of processes that emits CO2 that cannot be offset by using renewable energy. Cement manufacturer, large scale agriculture, and a lot of metallurgy emit CO2 by their nature. We do need active means of offsetting these carbon emissions.

John Oliver raises some good points about Bad actors in the carbon credit space. There are good actors, who genuinely want legitimate high quality carbon sequestration, and the biggest carbon buyers do seem like they want to get their money's worth. When it comes to evaluating different Technologies, the company probably matters as much as the technology. There are good applications for advanced weathering, direct air capture, biochar, Etc. There are also definitely very bad examples. The next 5 years are going to be very informative, since that is when a lot of the credits that have been sold by some of these companies are going to come due. I expect to see a lot of them under deliver, or fail entirely and leave big buyers very upset.",COMMENT

They hold a lot of potential, even with no further technology breakthroughs, to play a role in developed decarbonized energy systems. When we have surplus energy from wind and solar that the grid is unable to use, we can turn on carbon capture plants and start removing CO2 from the atmosphere. It doesn’t make huge sense currently but renewables are getting cheaper and rapidly expanding in adoption. There will eventually be a tipping point where everyone is served by offsetting or outright reversing the grid’s carbon emissions. 

We can work with the existing system of land trusts and land management in the US that converts the 11% firearm and ammunition excise tax into opportunities for hunting. Where I live (Illinois) we have been putting effort into restoring prairie acreage. That is a form of carbon capture that isn’t hugely net positive for the atmosphere, but is a huge win for native species habitat. Managing forests to allow more old growth, restoring keystone species like bison, etc all are soft carbon capture that yields huge other benefits. 

Similarly, there are a lot of problems being caused by expanding human activity like the sargassum belts in the Caribbean that can be solved in a way that captures carbon. One startup essentially goes out and sinks huge volumes of sargassum into the deep ocean to reduce what washes into beaches. Other small companies are making bricks out of sargassum.

Submission Statement

[OP is a carbon capture expert](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/charles-f-harvey/), and founder of the first US carbon capture firm (15 years ago, when he thought the technology might work). The crux of his argument is that every dollar invested in renewables is far more effective in reducing carbon dioxide than carbon capture technology. Furthermore, this gap is widening. Renewable+Storage gets cheaper every year, but carbon capture does not.

Yes, it's better to heavily invest in renewables over fossil fuels. The problem is that it takes time for the renewables to come online, from building the infrastructure to training the people to run it. So throwing some investment at CCS helps bridge the gap. Ideally renewable power generation will completely overtake fossil and we can phase it out.

CCS isn't a solution, it's a stopgap.

Edit: That said, they're doing the right thing in bringing up the fact that it shouldn't be seen as a solution. But just wholesale dismissing it because it isn't good enough isn't the right way to change something that has been the predominant method in a 100+ year old industry.",COMMENT

w2u9be,eli5: How does carbon capture technology work? Is it a viable option?,nappynapkin,2,6,,CARBON CAPTURE
igsfvvj,t3_w2u9be,agate_,7,0,"There are several different kinds of carbon capture, and they differ a lot in their practicality.

First, where you get the CO2 from:

* Source carbon capture grabs CO2 as it leaves a power plant or other fixed source.
* Direct air carbon capture pulls CO2 after it's been dumped into the atmosphere.

The benefit of free-air capture is that it can capture CO2 from small moving sources like cars that can't be hooked up to pipes.  The big, big drawback is that it costs a lot more energy and resources to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere after it's already mixed in.

Direct-air capture systems are about [5-10 times](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/is-carbon-capture-too-expensive) more expensive to operate than source capture systems, and the cost of capturing the CO2 is far higher than the cost of the fuel you burned to create the CO2 in the first place.

Second, where you put the CO2:

* Geological storage: You can liquefy it and store it deep underground -- for instance in depleted oil wells.  The underground pressure keeps it liquid, and the same geological formations that trapped the oil for millions of years will trap the CO2.  As a side benefit the CO2 displaces any remaining oil and forces it out, so the oil companies like this one.  The risk is that these reservoirs might leak in the future, dumping the CO2 back into the atmosphere.
* Ocean storage: You can liquefy it and dump it into the deep ocean, where it will quickly dissolve into the deep sea water.  This has less risk of sudden leaks, but guarantees that it will eventually come to the surface after a few centuries of ocean circulation, and it's very bad for seafloor marine life.
* Mineral storage: You can react it with volcanic rock to convert it into limestone.  This is permanent, no risk of leaks, and mimics the Earth's natural CO2 mineralization processes.  But it's incredibly slow, and requires digging and moving around a phenomenal amount of rock -- digging up hundreds of times more rock than the volume of the [largest open-pit mines in the world](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/15-largest-mines-on-earth), every single year.

Probably the cheapest and most effective of these technologies in the short term is source carbon capture and storage in underground reservoirs.  This can only be used where power plants are near old oil reservoirs, so it's limited.  Our current estimate is that using it would would use up so much energy that we'd end up burning [10-40%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage) more fossil fuels, just to dispose of the CO2 created by burning fossil fuels.  As a result this form of CCS would add about 30-60% to the cost of electricity.

The other methods are even more energy-consuming and expensive.  As mentioned above, in many cases you would end up burning fuel to create 1 unit of energy, then using 2 or more units of energy just to dispose of the CO2 from the first unit.  At which point, why are you bothering to burn the fuel in the first place?

Future research and development may bring the cost of these technologies down, but there are some fundamental physical limits to how efficient this process can get.  In particular, the [theoretical minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture#Environmental_impact) energy to extract CO2 from the air is about 18% of the [electricity produced by burning that fuel](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references).

To sum up and editorialize a bit: source carbon capture is very expensive, and won't work everywhere, but it could work.  Direct air carbon capture is *incredibly* expensive, so much so that it's a waste of energy until we kick our fossil fuel habit entirely.",COMMENT
igs9kka,t3_w2u9be,Gnonthgol,5,0,"We do not have a universal solution but there are some technologies we are working on which work in different scenarios. The easiest is for mounting in areas of almost pure carbon dioxide already such as in the smoke plume of power plants and cement factories. You can just mount a compressor to this gas to collect it and then maybe run it though some filters to get rid of unwanted chemicals. This is currently how most of the commercially sold carbon dioxide is made today. Either capturing the carbon dioxide from fermentation vats in the alcohol manufacturing industry or the drug manufacturing industry or capturing the carbon dioxide from fertelizer manufacturing which use natural gas as input.

Another technique is to use molecular sives. These can be tuned to the correct size of molecules so that they absorb only carbon dioxide sized molecules. If you put these sives under vaccuum they release their captured molecules. The issue is that compressing and the evaccuating these molecular sives takes quite a bit of power. However this is a fairly common technique to remove unwanted carbon dioxide from natural gas processing plants to purify the output. However the grade of the carbon dioxide captured is not of commercial value, however due to the closeness to natural gas wells there is projects ongoing to pump the carbon dioxide back into the well where it came from. Primarily to increase the pressure in the well so more natural gas can be extracted.

The third option is to use chemicals which will bond with carbon dioxide. There are a number of different such chemicals used today for carbon dioxide scrubbing. These spent scrubbers can be heated in order to reverse the chemical process and release the carbon dioxide. The advantage of this process is that unlike the previously mentioned techniques you can viably capture carbon dioxide from low concentration gasses such as our atmosphere. The disadvantage is that heating the scrubbers requires huge amounts of energy. The only place I have heard this technology be suggested is to capture carbon dioxide for use in greenhouses where the extra heat will be needed to heat the greenhouse anyway.",COMMENT

So, 4.5 lbs of CO2 (what it captures per 20,000 miles) is very close to zero. It's far less than what one gallon of gasoline creates. It's in the range of what you emit by burning a small candle or breathe out after eating a hamburger. 

Additionally, these carbon filters aren't weightless. The car carries them around, wasting additional energy.

I assume the filters aren't passive, so they consume some amount of additional energy to operate.

That's not even counting the emissions from their manufacture and initial transport. These filters almost certainly emit more CO2 than they capture.

If carbon capture is ever viable (which is questionable), it will be viable at an industrial scale and it will be *stationary*. Why would you build a carbon capture plant and then haul it around the fucking country?",COMMENT

I often imagine an indoor farming system I call ""milk bag farming"" based off the plastic milk bags we used to get milk in on the east coast of Canada. Basically these plastic bags would be made from biopolymers synthesized from the culture you're growing. You would just hook them up a hydroponics system, grow photosynthesizing cyanobacteria in greenhouses, and supply them with water and fertilizer. Once the bag fills, disconnect it from the hydroponics system like a plump fruit and reattach a new one, already seeded with its own sample of cyanobacteria. Then you just toss the whole bag into a chemical solution where it gets broken down into more substrates for polymers. Both the bacteria and the bag, too, since they're made of the same stuff. A continuously renewable loop.

You could even use transgenic cyanobacteria that overproduce the particular compounds you want, and have different strains for different polymers, or produce biofuel, or just bake it in a coke oven and compress the leftover graphite into bricks and build a 200 billion metric ton pyramid from them. Which is about as much you would actually have to produce to meaningfully displace the amount anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. (remember graphite is just the carbon without the oxygen) And would be thousands of times larger than the actual pyramids. Or perhaps we could make thousands of regular sized pyramids.

Animal agriculture is a catastrophe that we need to address.  A 2018 meta-analysis in Science drew from 570 studies to examine approximately 38,700 farms from 119 countries and over 40 products which accounted for approximately 90 percent of global protein and calorie consumption.  The study found that:

>Moving from current diets to a diet that excludes animal products...has transformative potential, reducing food’s land use by 3.1 (2.8 to 3.3) billion ha (a 76% reduction), including a 19% reduction in arable land; food’s GHG emissions by 6.6 (5.5 to 7.4) billion metric tons of CO2eq (a 49% reduction); acidification by 50% (45 to 54%); eutrophication by 49% (37 to 56%); and scarcity-weighted freshwater withdrawals by 19% (−5 to 32%) for a 2010 reference year.[\[1\]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaq0216)

And when accounting for lost carbon uptake opportunities:

>In total, the “no animal products” scenario delivers a 28% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy relative to 2010 emissions....[\[2\]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw9908)

We are seeing the effects of this.  Beyond climate disasters, animal products - especially red meat and dairy - are responsible for increasing food insecurity.[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/qnazy4/expressing_outrage_at_factory_farming_makes/hjhn6c0?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)  Things are likely to only get worse, as the global consumption of meat is expected to rise by 14 percent by 2030.[\[4\]](https://doi.org/10.1787/19991142)  Still, high-income nations keep subsidizing animal products with little return on environmental outcomes.  In the USA:

>One study estimates that about 63 percent of US subsidies benefit animal food producers.[\[5\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=43983)  Applying this percentage to the $57.3 billion farm subsidy total, and adding $2.3 billion for fish subsidies...the total of annual subsidies to US producers of animal foods is an estimated $38.4 billion.[\[6\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10818-010-9091-8)[\[7\]](https://meatonomics.com/the-book/)

One author estimated that for every dollar in retail sales of animal products, the food industry imposes $1.70 of external costs on society.[\[8\]](https://meatonomics.com/the-book/)  This is similar to the results of a study which found that most animal products require a roughly 2.5 times increase in price to cover their embedded climate costs.[\[9\]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19474-6)

Ignoring all the other environmental issues, if we just want to keep global warming below 2°C, we need to drastically reduce our consumption of meat.  One study found that:

>...even if fossil fuel emissions were immediately halted, current trends in global food systems would prevent the achievement of the 1.5°C target and, by the end of the century, threaten the achievement of the 2°C target.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba7357)

So what can we do?  Clearly just telling people about the issues and encouraging them to consume fewer animal products isn't having enough of an effect.  One author proposes a three-part solution:

>First, adjust taxes to make animal foods more costly and to put cash in taxpayers' pockets.  Beyond the financial boost, this change would give consumers more accurate price signals and lead to an important shift in consumption patterns.  Second, restructure the USDA, clarifying its purpose to ensure that industry influence is minimized and consumers receive accurate information.  And third, adjust federal support programs to reduce spending and better align financial support with policy goals.[\[11\]](https://meatonomics.com/the-book/)

While the author was speaking specifically of the USA, I think the same general solution applies to any middle- to high-income country.  If we're going to make any real effort to avoid a further climate and food-security disaster, we need to start charging the true cost of animal products, and it needs to become a serious part of our political discussion.

We're Yuan Jiang, Dave Heldebrant, and Casie Davidson from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and we're here to talk about carbon capture. Under DOE's Carbon Capture Program, researchers are working to both advance today's carbon capture technologies and uncover ways to reduce cost and energy requirements. We're happy to discuss capture goals, challenges, and concepts. Technologies range from aqueous amines - the water-rich solvents that run through modern, commercially available capture units - to energy-efficient membranes that filter CO2 from flue gas emitted by power plants. Our newest solvent, [EEMPA](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/cheaper-carbon-capture-way), can accomplish the task for as little as [$47.10 per metric ton](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/new-generation-carbon-dioxide-traps-could-make-carbon-capture-practical-bringing) - bringing post-combustion capture within reach of 45Q tax incentives.

TLDR: very expensive to retro fit old plants, expensive for an add on for new plants. The plant in the article says it’s a $1.1 billion carbon capture system. But later says smaller plants could be retrofitted for $372 - $600 million.

The tech is still relatively young and needs more time to optimize well and work with other tech. One example in the article said after an unexpected fly ash contamination required a change in the processing, the carbon capture was only at best 50% for a number of years. 

The example plant in the article only collects 80% of the the carbon, 3/4 of that 80% is pumped into the ground to pump more oil. The rest is pumped into deep underground caverns where it sits. Not a great long term solution. 

It’s up to you how worthwhile all that sounds and potential promise that brings. But it would seem wiser to me to invest in other ways. Instead of investing hard into tech that should instead be on its way out.

jkt0cag,t3_13m3bdu,Gnonthgol,11,0,"Most of the serious large scale carbon capture projects is doing exactly this. But this comes with its own issues. When you burn coal or oil you do not just get carbon dioxide but also lots of sot, tar, acids, radioactive isotopes, and tons of water vapor. This damages the filters used for capturing the carbon dioxide.

There are other chemical processes which produce more pure carbon dioxide. Most notably cement production does output almost pure carbon dioxide from one of their processes. This is a major contributor to carbon dioxide emission with over 30% of the worlds emissions coming from cement production. It is hard to retrofit an existing cement plant with carbon capture technology as they do not collect the gas from the process and also tends to mix it with gas from burning coal or oil which is used as a heat source for the process. But new cement plant is built to capture the pure carbon dioxide and make it easily available for carbon capture.",COMMENT

In addition, it’s hard to do, and the concentration isn’t ‘that’ much higher from smokestacks than in the open air (it is usually 20% co2 iirc), which requires filtering. Then you need a place to store ( sequester) the carbon permanently with no leaks. This is hard to do on an industrial scale, and requires infrastructure that there just wasn’t the need to develop.",COMMENT
jktn0nm,t3_13m3bdu,rileyoneill,5,0,"Energy is very price sensitive.  A power plant operator has the business plan of producing power for as cheap as possible and then selling it for the most they can (for the most part, there are some exceptions to this).   Power plants have annual operating costs, which they want to minimize, an then they have revenue which they get from selling the power.   These costs include the actual operations and maintenance costs, fuel costs, and finance costs.    


The big reason why carbon capture isn't used, is because it adds a lot of cost to the power plant, but does not produce more energy to sell, or somehow get them a higher price.  It just add cost.  While a government could force companies to do this, it would create a lot of problems and instability that would likely result in a new government which repeals the regulation.   Customers hate high prices, politically sensitive districts hate seeing major employers go through problems.    


With all the money that it would take to retrofit a power plant for carbon capture, they would be far better off just using that money and buying solar panels, wind turbines, batteries (and in some areas, geothermal).  The prices of those technologies are so cheap that in much of the country its cheaper to replace your fossil fuel plants with renewables than it is to operate your fossil fuel plants.    


A way that companies and investors look at investments is by taking the total amount of profit generated from selling energy for the year, an then dividing that profit by the total amount of energy sold.   I need to be clear, this is energy SOLD, not energy produced. Its possible to produce energy and not have a buyer.    


So it would look like this.  (Annual Revenue - Annual Costs)/Total power sold.   This gives us a Price per unit energy.   This is a price per kilowatt hour kWh or megawatt hour MWh.    Investors and utility companies want assets that have a very very low cost per kWh.  The lowest is the best.     


The the ""Annual Revenue"", the power companies want that to be as high as possible, ideally infinity.  That would mean infinite money.  Which if you are a business, is the best way to win the game.  You want the annual costs to be as low as possible.  Ideally zero.     


The worst case scenario is where the annual costs are greater than the annual revenue.  This would mean that it would cost $100 to make $90.  This would mean that the best business decision would be to shut the plant down as it is a money loser.  Any sort of power plant that loses money every year would be in this scenario.    


The government can do subsidies, these subsidies can either raise the annual revenue, or reduce the annual costs, and since utility companies like free stuff from the government, ideally both.   


The carbon capture technology does nothing to lower this cost per kWh.  All it does is make their existing assets more expensive to operate.     


The utility companies have options.  Instead of buying carbon capture technology, which does nothing for them, they can use their money to buy solar panels and windmills, and very soon, utility scale energy storage (or in some places, pumped storage).  All of these assets have a very low cost per kWh that is only getting cheaper (solar is already the cheapest way to generate electricity, but its not 24/7).      


This is why you are not really seeing carbon capture pop up, but you are seeing a lot of solar panels, windmills, and if you live in California or South Australia, batteries.  Its a better use of money to skip the plant upgrades, put money into renewables.   


There is a double whammy effect.  As these renewables become more common, their prices continue to decline, which push more people to buy them.  But they also push down wholesale energy market prices during certain periods (such as anytime the sun is out, or any time there is a breeze, and double if it is sunny and breezy at the same time).    These cause the older power plants to make less revenue per year.    


So in addition to making less revenue, their costs will go up.  Remember that worst case scenario I brought up, where the annual costs are greater than the annual revenue, that is what could happen as renewable energy disrupts markets.

kc3kz8g,t3_18anuzd,oldschoolhillgiant,3,0,"Like ""hydrogen economy"" if you try to distill it down to an elevator pitch, you are including enough wiggle room to hide a whole lot of sins.  

Sequestering carbon is very easy from a technical standpoint.  Put it in water, pump the water into a young basalt formation, and wait a little bit.  They are doing it in Iceland right now.  The is a verifiable storage good for geologic time scales.  

The problem is capture.  Well, the technical problem is capture.  It is energy intensive even if you are trying to capture it at the stack.  Verifying that you have captured what you said you were going to capture is tricky.  Transporting it to the ""young basalt"" formation without loosing appreciable amounts is also tricky.  Direct Air Capture is even more expensive from an energy standpoint, a capital standpoint, and an operation standpoint.

Which brings me to the real kicker as to how serious any proposal is.  There is no direct economic benefit for carbon capture.  So, who is paying for it?  We can require that Big Oil do it in exchange for continuing to operate or we can have governments pay for it.  I can bet that you can easily figure out which option Big Oil would prefer.",COMMENT

hu63whw,t3_sccrkx,everfixsolaris,24,1,"TLDR: the title is misleading and click bait.

More relevant title: ""Shell's CCS plant proves Blue Hydrogen is not as Eco-friendly as touted""

Facts: 

\- Shell touted plant as a ""thriving example"" of CCS working to reduce emissions

\- Industry promised 90% capture, plant captures 48%

\- $654 Million of the $1 Billion cost was payed by the government from subsidies

Not Oniony: Might as well have said ""Oil Company puts lipstick on a pig using Government funding to keep doing business as usual"".

&#x200B;

Further analysis:

\-Blue hydrogen is touted as an Eco-friendly fuel for vehicles as a competitor against battery powered vehicles.

\-The plant is instead using it as a process gas to break down heavy oil-sand tar into fuel

So the outrage in in the article is that Shell is funneling funds for cutting down on emissions to produce more oil.  They are producing it in a more Eco-friendly manner but instead using the subsidy for wind, solar, battery powered vehicles, etc would generate better carbon reduction per dollar spent.",COMMENT
hu5l6sv,t3_sccrkx,crazydr13,45,1,"I work in evaluating facilities for carbon capture and one of the things we do is identify the single best exhaust stream for a CCUS retrofit. Capture systems incur a rather large energy debt (~30-50% of the energy produced from the carbon emissions) and have to be installed on a stack-by-stack basis. This means that we want to find the *most* carbon rich exhaust streams and target those for capture. The 48% of captured emissions is likely from a single unit or exhaust stack. Many of these refineries will have a single large emitting unit (like an FCCU in conventional petroleum refineries) with many smaller emissions sources from process heaters or flares that are uncaptureable. A CCS system can generally capture about 90% of the CO2 that goes through it, depending on the type of capture system deployed. 

Finally, many people believe that carbon capture is a means for large emitters to green wash their climate impact and not actually solve the problems they create. While this is true, carbon capture is the necessary solution to continue production of critical materials that will take many decades to decarbonize. I’ve worked on several projects to address decarbonizing the petrochemical industry (plastics, fertilizers, etc) and it’s a doozy without carbon capture. Even with carbon capture it’s still going to be an uphill battle but one that can’t be fixed with solar panels or wind turbines (but maybe with algae!).

u48pea,A Startup Is Engineering Trees to Grow Faster and Capture More Carbon,Sorin61,6411,285,,CARBON CAPTURE
i4u3r6t,t3_u48pea,FuturologyBot,1,0,"The following submission statement was provided by /u/Sorin61:

---

A company called Living Carbon is engineering trees that can capture and store more carbon than typical trees. The company plans to share more details about the technology later in the year, but it builds on previous research, including years of work from other scientists looking at how to enhance photosynthesis in other plants.  
For a tree, faster growth means that it can take up more CO2. Living Carbon is also developing a second innovation for the trees that slows the rate that the tree decomposes; the process will enable trees to take up copper and nickel, which act as fungicides. (Fungi speed the decomposition of wood, leading to loss of CO2.)

Given this, it would only take a tax of $0.45 per gallon of gas, funding carbon capture to completely offset the emissions of gas cars on the road today.

k4zhwk9,t3_17811el,Atmos_Dan,9,3,"I’m an atmospheric chemist who now does carbon capture. 

You have the right idea but there’s a couple nuances. It’s very unlikely that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will ever be deployed to cars and short-range transportation. Those emissions could be abated by electrification or hydrogen (in the long term). In the very long term, any applications that need a molecule can be abated using synthetic, zero carbon drop-in fuels. 

Most CCS projects are focused on very large industrial units that have a relatively high concentration of CO2 in their exhaust. The capture costs vary widely for these exhaust streams from sources like ethanol (~$10-20USD/metric ton) to gas fired power plants (~$70-80USD/metric ton). These costs will also change depending on whether you’re going to store the CO2 in geologic reservoirs or use another method. Further, transportation costs will also play in here. For example, there’s a ton of ethanol in the upper Midwest but very little storage so the price to capture and store a ton of CO2 there will be higher than an ethanol plant near the Gulf Coast (which has high quality low cost storage opportunities). 

There are currently few economic incentives to do CCS apart from government subsidies and tax credits. In the US, 45Q gives operators up to $85/metric ton for CO2 tucked away into long term storage. This is plenty for the majority of industries to either make a profit or at the least break even. 

CCS projects are very expensive and essentially need the facility configuration to be retooled. At power plants, capture equipment will induce a ~30% parasitic load on the total electrical output. Advances in capture technology and operational efficiencies will likely bring that number down but it’s still expensive and energy intensive. 

This is a bit of a brain dump but please feel free to ask any questions you may have about CCS.",COMMENT
k4xu8gr,t3_17811el,brickbatsandadiabats,17,1,"Full disclosure, I work in industry and deal with carbon capture on a near-daily basis.  

One, you are conflating carbon capture and sequestration as a whole with direct air capture.  This is one form of it, but by and large, numbers in the range you cite are for carbon capture from industrial sources with high concentration, not the air.  You can expect DAC to be at least $100+ per ton, realistically up to 4 times that amount depending on the price of the energy you're using for it.

Google will give you a number but it's up to you to see what's behind that number.  CCS has been studied as a general subject for much longer than direct air capture as a subset of it.  The number you were getting was likely a DOE study on partial stack gas capture or similar, and unless it specifically includes sequestration, it's also likely understating cost as well.  Estimates from industry licensors I've seen for non-DAC avoided cost of carbon from e.g. Linde are in the range of $60-$70 if sequestration is included.

The second thing you're missing is that even if it were that cheap to offset, people go ABSOLUTELY BUGNUTS INSANE about even tiny increases on fuel prices.  We've had political fights here in the US about raising various Federal and State gasoline taxes to keep pace with inflation where politicians are so cowardly they will refuse to raise a levy that hasn't been adjusted in 30 years, and paper over the gigantic budget holes they leave.  The Gilets Jaunes protests in France were started over a small environmental levy on fuel.  All over the world, people's inflation perception is linked to fuel even though it's a volatile commodity that has little to do with actual inflation, and it's especially true in the US.  Doing shit to change the fixed cost of motor fuel is political suicide.  It's stupid but +$.10 a gallon can lose an election. 

The third thing you're missing is that the point of a carbon tax is not to use the revenue for anything.  It's to encourage people to make the right decisions on how to spend.  The price rises are the point, so people can perceive the correct price and cut fuel use in favor of other spending; the revenues don't need to be used for offsetting emissions because the pricing mechanism does it for you.  In fact it's ideal for revenue to be returned to the taxed because it's an inherently regressive tax, and that's the last thing we need for poor people.  Though it's now fashionable among activists to want to use one as a government revenue source to fund spending, it's at best a misunderstanding of the policy, and at worst proof they care more about spending on their favored causes than poor people's income.

Final note, the technology for capture works but sequestration is still technically risky at power plant scale.  Lots of people sprouting bad takes here but the core is still true. With so much risk still in geological sequestration, it's likely to be a part of future industry but almost certainly not for basic energy uses, because those are too big and the alternatives for decarbonizing so much cheaper.  It's far more likely to be used for things like fertilizer or small chemical plant emissions than for power or heating, which are collectively orders of magnitude larger and less able to bear high prices than chemicals.",COMMENT

The $50/tonne figure is based on capturing and sequestering CO2 from an industrial source of concentrated CO2, often at pressure. A classic example is natural gas production where the CO2 content is too high, and it must be removed for sale.

This is beneficial and we should do it as much as possible while we decarbonise those industries. In some cases - such as aluminium - we have no viable alternatives. A carbon tax is hugely politically unpopular for these industries though, which is why they have only succeeded in some places.

Unfortunately it's not practical to capture CO2 from most traditional power plants, due to the energy required to separate it from nitrogen. There are some alternative designs that enable energy efficient capture but they are expensive (and not popular to build due to the continued use of fossil fuels).

""Quest has safely captured over 7 million tonnes of CO2."" <- since it started operation in 2015.

The real number she should be using is ""avoided"", not captured.  Because the captured part includes the extra CO2 that the capturing process generates, not the CO2 that the plant actually didn't emit.   I kid you not.

The Alberta government has sunk many hundreds of millions of dollars into Quest.

Meanwhile, the electricity generation displacement factor is 0.52 tonnes/MWh in Alberta.

[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/47299476-8943-4c8b-9205-432f1102d847/resource/667e1950-9ea2-4c84-8f9a-088451b7e937/download/aep-methodology-for-the-electricity-grid-displacement-factor.pdf](https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/47299476-8943-4c8b-9205-432f1102d847/resource/667e1950-9ea2-4c84-8f9a-088451b7e937/download/aep-methodology-for-the-electricity-grid-displacement-factor.pdf)

In 2022 a total of 55.5 TWhs were generated in Alberta. 10.75% of that came from wind and solar.

[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/powering-future-clean-energy/overview-alberta.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/powering-future-clean-energy/overview-alberta.html)

Wind and solar are saving 3.1 million tonnes of CO2 emission **per year**.  Nearly 4x what Quest is doing. All with **ZERO** investment from the Alberta government.

55.5 TWh x 10.75% x 0.52 tonnes = 3.1 million tonnes PER YEAR.

For 2023, renewables will generate closer to 15% of Alberta's electricity.

So ironic that DS is giving a speech at a CCS conference touting how Alberta is going to be a leader in CCS.

The money the government has spent on Quest is as follows:

|Year|Amount (Millions $)||
|:-|:-|:-|
|2009|3.226||
|2010|1.817||
|2011|1.303||
|2012|238||

|2019|30.050||
|2020|27.033||
|2021|29.006||
|Total|$749.745||

Yes, the Alberta government has sunk nearly $750M into the Quest project.  Remember that number the next time your community needs better education or health care.

What is really funny is if you calculate the cost per tonne that the ALBERTA government is spending to remove the carbon.  In 2021 the Alberta government gave Shell $29M to fund the operation of Quest.   Quest avoided 0.823 M tonnes of CO2, for a cost to the GOVERNMENT of $35/tonne.   That does not include Shell's cost.   That is what the taxpayer paid Shell to operate Quest.

FYI, the OPERATING costs for Quest for 2022 are:

|Item|$/tonne Avoided||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Capture|132.16||
|Transport|11.38||
|Storage|16.68||
|Total|$160.42||

These are Shell's numbers, not mine.  Straight from their report.

A typical CCS generation plant emits 400 Kg/MWh.  At $160/tonne, CCS would add $64/MWh to the cost of generation.

Quest is an example of what the UCP wants to do across the O&G and electricity generation sector.  It will be a complete nightmare.  Don't believe me ?  Look at how SaskPower is making out with the Boundary Dam CCS project.   An even worse nightmare.

The BS in her speech is just incredible.  Non stop lies and fantasies.

There will be a HUGE CCS announcement in the near future.  It will involve massive, massive handouts to the O&G industry.

""We believe Ottawa's plans will drive away future investment"".  This is the woman that single handedly shut down renewable projects !   Furthermore, the renewables industry is exploding without any of the investment that she is complaining aobut.

Smith is DREAMING if she thinks Canada is going to get emissions credits for shipping LNG over to countries presently burning coal.  Emissions credits don't work that way.

And, of course, she drums the hydrogen drum, yet again.  It is complete fantasy that a hydrogen economy is going to develop and if it is that Alberta would be a key player in it.

And, of course, she blames Ottawa for all of it.  Meanwhile Alberta farmers are suffering yet another drought and of course, our forests burn.

I can't believe that the press/media don't report on this and explain the situation to the public.

One more thing... the Alberta government put $750M into Quest, all to ~~capture~~ avoid 0.823M tonnes/year.  The Alberta O&G industry needs to avoid about 80M tonnes/year to get to net zero and the electricity sector another 25M tonnes/year.   The scale of what DS is proposing is astronomical. 

Meanwhile the AUC has about 20 GW of solar projects sitting in the queue, enough generation for twice Alberta's average grid load. ",CARBON CAPTURE

17spskk,Carbon Capture will only perpetuate the western corrupt political model,mhicreachtain,109,68,"The fossil fuel industry poisons not only the atmosphere but the whole western capitalist system. Huge oil and gas profits corrupt politicians and their parties, buy the media and distort the financial system. Less developed but carbon rich nations are exploited by oil companies, and western states undermine and attack any form of government that doesn't allow for the extraction of profit through fossil fuels.

Carbon Capture will only perpetuate this exploitation. In the short term it provides useful cover for governments awarding new oil and gas licences with the illusory promise that the carbon emissions will be captured. But even if this is true, the vast profits will be used to buy a watering down of the speed to introduce carbon capture and the amount of carbon required to be captured. Also, the financial power will be used to counter the momentum of the move to renewable energy.

What we as a species need is a global renewable power grid connecting all the wind, tidal, solar electricity production that would ensure 24 hour access to clean energy for all. This could rid us of the corrupt fossil fuel system that exploits us all and poisons our politics.

The potential of carbon capture technology is to further our path to dystopia through business as usual.

EDIT: Thank you for the responses but I should clarify the original post. 

I was referring to carbon capture and storage from fossil fuel energy production rather than direct air capture. My point is how the fossil fuel industry and their fellow beneficiaries use the technology to continue their harmful business model rather than a discussion about the technology. Sorry if I misled anyone.

Direct air capture would be a wonderful thing, but my point is that the industry, governments, media etc are using this possibility to avoid taking responsibility for the damage they are doing. Also DAC would not end the neo-liberal capitalist model that exploits oil rich but less developed countries by forcing an extreme free market capitalism on them no matter what the population chooses democratically. My point is about the toxic nature of fossil fueled neo-liberalism, how the vast profits from oil and gas empower this system and how carbon capture and storage will allow this model to continue against the needs of the global population and for the minority of super rich who benefit disproportionately.

kaav1ux,t3_18122dh,Cool_Ad217,23,4,"So I'm a geologist in the CCS industry. There are currently 169 Class VI wells (58 total CCS projects) that have submitted permits with the EPA. Currently, the EPA basically contracts all of the technical review (geology, well design, monitoring) to a consulting company called Cadmus in the DC area. Right now, they say it takes roughly 2 years to get a Class VI permit, I think it's more like 3 years. The EPA and their contractors aren't currently set up to handle the volume of permits that they have on their plate. The EPA has beefed up its staff, but government hiring is slow, arduous, and not great at getting O&G talent who has the skill set at reviewing technical geology. You have to drill a strat test, collect logs/core, do core analysis and make a geo model to run a reservoir simulation. That takes 6 months to build plus a couple months to massage into a Class VI permit - 1 year of project design + 2 years EPA review = 3 years to get permit to construct. 

North Dakota and Wyoming have primacy. Red Trail Energy is an ethanol plant in North Dakota that is actively injecting \~ 150,000 tons CO2 per year - they were permitted by the State of North Dakota. There is another injector in Illinois in the Mt. Simon but I am not sure if it is active or not. I think Louisiana is up next to get primacy, but the approval process from the EPA takes a long time. Again, I think not enough staff and resources. There's probably a lot of red tape to push through. 

When does the industry start booming? I ask myself that probably every other day. We just got a massive investment from the feds in CCS - billions of dollars for pilot projects. Where I work, we have a ton of private and federal work pouring in. There was roughly $2 billion in private investment in CCS this year. I see a lot of major companies forming partnerships - O&G operators forming offtake agreements with CO2 emitters. Last month, Exxon bought Denbury... I don't think that was an accident. They now have the largest CO2 pipeline infrastructure in the world. 

45Q gives us $85/ton of CO2, capture cost is roughly $35/ton. There really is money to be earned here - you can pass on tax credits to your investors as well nowadays with current legislation. I think the economics are now in place. Every major corporation in America has a net zero climate goal - so I think GHG reduction strategies are here to stay. Even coal companies that I talk to have a board with a net zero obligations now. 

Many of these 169 Class VI wells will get approved by the EPA in the near future. I know several submitters that got back detailed comments back from EPA and made modifications. Hopefully when the permits are approved, companies start constructing their wells. 

There certainly have been problems, namely the Navigator pipeline - but that was a pretty risky project. I expect to see CO2 pipelines, Class VI construction, and other infrastructure picking up in places like the Texas Coast, Louisiana, southern Alabama. There are a lot of pending permits in California - but people in that state really hate CCS so I just don't know how it happens there outside of Bakersfield. These are my thoughts!",COMMENT

Stephen Chu was Secretary of Energy under Obama, and is a techno-optimist, but his predictions are far more realistic than others who share his centrist credentials. It's refreshing to hear an establishment thinker openly state how dire things are. 

However, there seem to be aspects missing from his analysis, eg the social ramifications of the temperature spikes that he sees coming, and the effects of continued temperature rise on wildlife, food, conflict etc etc. Related to collapse because 2.5 - 3 degrees rise spells disaster for food, security and economics.

Another interesting progression in scientific studies to organically remove CO2, but not the magic solution. I think we need to think pretty hard about.introducing things to new environments, that could potentially do more damage to the local life. 

I like that there are so many studies involving currently existing microorganisms because creating carbon capture technology won't be much help before environmental collapse if it takes too long to develop. Carbon capture in itself isn't the solution anyway.

17tgm5w,Carbon Capture and Storage will only perpetuate fossil fueled Neo-liberal Capitalism,mhicreachtain,14,3," 

The fossil fuel industry poisons not only the atmosphere but the whole western capitalist system. Huge oil and gas profits corrupt politicians and their parties, buy the mass media and distort the financial system. Less developed but carbon rich nations are exploited by oil companies, and western states undermine and attack any form of government that doesn't allow for the extraction of profit through fossil fuels.

I am referring to carbon capture and storage from fossil fuel energy production rather than direct air capture. This Carbon Capture will only perpetuate this exploitation. In the short term it provides useful cover for governments awarding new oil and gas licences with the illusory promise that the carbon emissions will be captured. But even if this is true, the vast profits will be used to buy a watering down of the speed to introduce carbon capture and the amount of carbon required to be captured. Also, the financial power will be used to counter the momentum of the move to renewable energy.

What we, as a species, need is a global renewable power grid, or grids, connecting all the wind, tidal, solar, geo-thermal electricity production that would ensure 24 hour access to clean energy for all. This could rid us of the corrupt fossil fuel system that exploits us all and poisons our politics. The constant mass media attacks on any left wing politicians and parties is to protect the profits of the super rich minority. Those profits are largely derived from fossil fuels. The socialist and environmental agendas are interconnected.

Carbon capture technology and other technologies that will allow the continuation of the fossil fuel industry will further our path to dystopia.

10jkize,Carbon Capture and Storage question.,Digger1422,11,5,"I’m an mining and environmental engineer in the cement industry, and I had a question regarding carbon sequestration, specifically nitrogen. 

There is a lot of effort involved separating the CO2 from the nitrogen in the post combustion gasses. So much that we are even looking at removing nitrogen prior to combustion, to make the amine process more efficient.

If there were a sufficiently large geological storage reservoir to hold the entirety of the gasses, could you compress them all together into a supercritical state? IE could you just skip the separation process entirely and inject everything as a “mixed solution” ?  

I understand the geology questions, but supercritical fluids are basically magic to me so I’d be interested what you all think.",CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE
j5oirxf,t3_10jkize,brickbatsandadiabats,6,0,"
The single largest expenditure of energy in sequestration is not the carbon dioxide separation but the compressors required to get the gas to pressure, for pipeline spec typically around 80 atmg. Your typical flue gas is only around 10% CO2 or less on a dry basis, since most combustion processes operate with excess air.  If you're doing the math that also means considering the residual ~10% oxygen as well. So avoiding the separation takes your most energy intensive step and makes it 10X. 

That said there's no technical barrier to doing this at the inlet.  Oxygen and nitrogen both go supercritical before carbon dioxide does.

At the reservoir, oxygen and nitrogen would limit your reservoir type; deep saline aquifers are an ineffective storage medium for nitrogen because it's only slightly soluble in water. Thus you'd mostly be limited to old oil and gas beds, with lower capacity because there's still the expectation in those systems that some of the carbon dioxide saturates the brine present.  There's also the aspect that reservoirs are themselves a limited resource.  If you're going to inject roughly an order of magnitude more volume, you'll run out of reservoir a lot quicker.",COMMENT
j5lkfpb,t3_10jkize,Trench2Mount,4,1,"Several issues there storing post combustion gases in a geological reservoir:  
**1- Issue with high pressure:** Post combustion exhaust gases are low pressure, by compressing them to supercritical or even subcritical elevated pressure you are expending a lot of energy which itself in a world where energy partly comes from fossil fuel is counter productive let alone economically unfeasible.  
**2- Geological reservoirs:** There are no naturally sealed geological reservoirs. Unless you are able to provide a constant back-pressure, you won't be able to just inject some and leave and then come back and inject some more.    
**3- Transportation:** Geological reservoirs are geographically dispersed, hence you need pipelines or transportation for massive volumes which itself requires energy and CAPEX hence going against the idea of net negative carbon capture.",COMMENT

hui21eg,t3_se833r,girliesoftcheeks,783,9,"For anyone super interested: the technology that removes low concentration carbon dioxide from Ambient air is called Direct air capture (DAC). Traditionally we have captured higher concentrations C02 from large point sources such as smoke stacks (which is still a great idea) but with direct air capture we can adress historic CO2 emissions which we can't with point source. 

Basically: CO2 is ""trapped"" by a material (commercially right now either through a Liquid Absorbent or solid Adsorbent). When we heat this material we can release the trapped CO2 (regenerating the material for new use) and capture the C02 in a mostly pure gas stream. CO2 can be further utilised for many industries (even to make synthetic fuel) or simply stored somewhere untill we have not so much C02 clogging up the atmosphere anymore. 

Full disclosure: the technology described in the article for the leaf seems to be mix of liquid and solid. Can't claim I know the details on that. 

DAC is still a new technology, and therefore also still pretty costly, but it is effective and getting better every year. There are only somewhere around 19 plants in operation today. Yes it is different from trees. Trees store Carbon only untill they die and then release it when they decompose. They also require a large amount of land space and resources, DAC plants/untits can be built on land where trees won't thrive, possibly integrated into HVAC systems and stuff like that.",COMMENT

Another thing people don't understand is that it takes energy to get CO2 out of the air. The reason we put CO2 into the air is because we want energy. Even worse, our civilization requires a ratio energy out / energy in that is greater than 10. Removing CO2 reduces this ratio, because that energy is not available for anything else.",COMMENT

The process works by employing *stratospheric aerosol injection* and marine cloud brightening. Stratospheric aerosol injection is when sulfate particles are released into the atmosphere, where they are able to assist in reflecting sunlight. In marine cloud brightening, salt from the ocean would be used to increase the reflectiveness of clouds.""

zajpdu,White House is pushing ahead research on modifying the climate by aerosol injections into the stratosphere,zlaxy,76,50,"Scientists will assess if the benefits of aerosol injections outweigh  the risks. The idea of using sulfur dioxide for solar geoengineering  came in 1991 when Pinatubo erupted and released enough sulfates to cool  the Earth by 0.3°C for 3 years.

The White House is coordinating a 5-year [research plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/legal/)  to study ways of modifying the climate by reducing the amount of  sunlight that reaches the Earth. The process is known as solar  geoengineering or sunlight reflection and is aimed at fighting the  effects of global warming. The research plan will assess climate  interventions, including aerosol injections (spraying aerosols into the  stratosphere) to reflect sunlight back into space.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has been tasked with the [program](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/what-is-solar-geoengineering-sunlight-reflection-risks-and-benefits.html).  It should assess what impact these kinds of climate interventions may  have on Earth. There are three kinds of sunlight-reflection technology  being considered, including stratospheric aerosol injection, marine  cloud brightening and cirrus cloud thinning.

Stratospheric  aerosol injection involves spraying aerosols, for instance sulfur  dioxide, into the stratosphere by aircraft. The small particles are  expected to reflect the sunlight back to space and thus cooling the  Earth. It has the potential to affect the entire globe. Therefore,  scientists must assess if the benefits of such a method outweigh the  risks associated with spraying aerosols to humans and soil.

Despite  the protests of dozens of scientists world-wide, the previously  suspended program has been re-launched. At the same time, there is a  great risk of global imbalance as a result of climate interventions  around the world. Experiments in the field of solar geoengineering are  regulated by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. However, the  White House is pushing ahead a program the risks of which are still  unknown.

As a result of these experiments, solar energy may be  extremely unevenly distributed around the planet. If in the Northern  Hemisphere, for instance, average temperature dropped as a result of  reduced greenhouse effect and climate intervention, then in the Southern  Hemisphere the reverse process could result in drying the Amazon.

It has become increasingly clear that we will (and are already) experience very bad consequences from climate change even if we were able to elect Dark Brandon as king of the world and stop all Co2 emissions. The damage that we will see will be incalculable, people will be forced to leave their homes, there will be famine, war, and worse natural disasters. This will happen unless we use a tool that scientists are pretty confident will work but is not without its costs.

It is well documented that various types of aerosols have an extremely strong cooling effect. We have seen this historically with volcanic eruptions and pollution before the clean air act. Luckily to use this cooling we don't need to blow up a volcano or start polluting our cities again. Instead, we have the technology to inject aerosols such as S02 into the stratosphere where they will last longer and where they will cause very little impact on things like rain acidity and air quality due to their wide dispersal. To give you an idea of just how powerful this cooling affect is, one kilogram of sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide. The cooling effect would only last a couple of years, so to keep the planet cooled we would need to keep doing this, luckily the cost for this would only be on the order of 10 billion usd/yr . The biggest potential downside to this I've seen would be a reduction in precipitation in some areas. I would argue though that the negative effect on the water cycle from global warming would be much worse.

I am getting much of this info from here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric\_aerosol\_injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) . This website also has some cool simulations with shorter explanations: [https://geoengineering.global/stratospheric-aerosol-injection/#:\~:text=What%20is%20Stratospheric%20Aerosol%20Injection,reverse%20or%20stop%20Global%20Warming](https://geoengineering.global/stratospheric-aerosol-injection/#:~:text=What%20is%20Stratospheric%20Aerosol%20Injection,reverse%20or%20stop%20Global%20Warming).

EDIT: I think a lot of people may bring this point up: "" What is stopping people from arguing to just keep doing this and not change the system?"" A valid concern, but fortunately I think the economics will stand in the way of this. There simply aren't that many fossil fuels left to extract.

(Explanation in post)",OvidPerl,1702,152,"[Inspired by a Mastodon thread](https://mastodon.social/@sundogplanets/109876679977658045) by [Astronomy Professor Sam Lawler](https://www.uregina.ca/science/physics/people/faculty-research/samantha-lawler/index.html).

[Elon Musk plans 42,000 Starlink satellites](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-42000-starlink-satellites-earth-effects-stars-2020-10). With an operational lifespan of five years, after which they're de-orbited. We will have an average of 23 (42,000/(365*5)) satellites entering the Earth's atmosphere every day. 

[At 1,250 kg each (for the Starlink 2.0 satellites)](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-deploy-starlink-satellites-pez-dispenser), that's 29 tons of satellites entering our atmosphere every day, much of that being aluminum. In other words, that will be almost 10,000 tons of aluminum effectively being aerosolized in our upper atmosphere every year.

Have there been any environmental impact studies of this?

Side note: For those who point out that we have two to three times more meteorites (by mass) entering our atmosphere than Starlink satellites, the meteorites are mostly silicates.

Also, unlike [geoengineering techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) to inject aerosols into our atmosphere to combat global warming, we will have no effective way of shutting off the rain of Starlink satellites. Even if launches are stopped immediately, that's five years worth of satellites coming down.

There are a variety of papers in the last few years highlighting that both emissions from increasingly frequent rocket launches and material (like aluminum and other metals) added to the atmosphere via satellite deorbiting *could* have substantial impacts on a variety of things, but almost all of these are really calls for more attention and research as opposed to answers to the question itself (e.g., [Ross & Toohey, 2019](https://eos.org/features/the-coming-surge-of-rocket-emissions), [Hobbs et al., 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMGC0420004H/abstract), [Boley & Byers, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89909-7), [Schulz & Glassmeier, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117720307663), [Adilov et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0265964621000631), [Ross & Jones, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468896722000386), [Shutler et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01001-5), [Lawrence et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01655-6)). There is at least one paper directly trying to answer this with modelling for the emissions from increasingly frequent rocket launches (e.g., [Maloney et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JD036373)), but I at least could not find a paper actually demonstrating what the impact of addition of significant amounts of metal to the upper atmosphere would be (beyond the generalizations in the previously linked papers that suggest it would likely do something). The closest is really the Hobbs et al., 2020, but sadly this is an abstract for a conference presentation and I couldn't find a follow up (might still be in the works, lag time between stuff presented at conferences and eventual publication can definitely be several years). It does seem like there is a fair bit of interest in this within pockets of the scientific community (as illustrated by all the ""we should pay attention to this"" papers cited above), so I wouldn't be surprised if there are studies in the works on this, but at least for me it's far enough outside my area that I don't know that for sure (maybe others more in this space can provide some details).",COMMENT

Now from a climate standpoint- large amounts very tiny particles do have a measurable effect on global warming. If we're burning up a mass of aluminum on the same order as all of the meteorites that enter the atmosphere, then the effect is probably negligible, however.

16g9ehy,I'm very disturbed by the number of people who support climate engineering,bananas1224,368,360,"It's really not a good idea. 

I'm going to list a few points that form the basis of my opinion that it's really not a good idea.

1. Carbon dioxide emissions aren't just warming the planet. They are also making the ocean more acidic. Oceans uptake CO2. This lowers the pH of the ocean in a process called ocean acidification. If we keep emitting CO2, even with a perfect geoengineering scheme that offsets CO2 warming perfectly (unlikely), the oceans will still become more acidic. This is a global threat to ocean life. We need to stop emitting CO2 for that reason alone. 

2. The Earth is warming nonuniformly. The Arctic is warming 2-3x faster than the rest of the planet, termed Arctic amplification. Any geoengineering scheme must offset not only the global mean rise in temperature but also the pattern of warming. Some studies suggest that injecting aerosol in the  stratosphere may not offset Arctic amplification. This means that even if the global mean temperature is held fixed, the Arctic temperature may continue to rise. This could still lead to sea level rise. 

3. Unintended consequences. As a climate scientist, I can tell you this: we don't understand everything about climate change. Not even close, and I'm not trying to make us look bad. It's just a fact most people outside of academia don't realize. An example is climate sensitivity. A basic question, ""how much does the temperature rise when doubling CO2?"" varies by between 2 and 8 K in models participating CMIP6. This enormous spread has gotten bigger despite our best efforts to constrain climate models. Along these lines, it's worth noting that you can change extremely esoteric parameters in climate model, like convective entrainment rate, and change the climate sensitivity tremendously. And we don't know why. Now, knowing this, do you really feel comfortable injecting Aerosol into the stratosphere when the only source of knowledge we have on the impacts this would have come from models? Models that can't agree on climate sensitivity for reasons we don't understand, despite decades of research? Let me be clear: we know CO2 is warming the planet and we know why. But there are tons of things we don't understand. Another example is the hydrological cycle. We don't have a full grasp of how/why precipitation will change from raising CO2. There are papers about it constantly. So, we certainly don't know what would happen to the hydrological cycle if we add Aerosol to the stratosphere. The fact is this: the consequence of injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere has a non negligible chance of making things worse. I don't have enough trust in climate models to make decisions about geoengineering based on their predictions, and this is coming from someone who works at lab developing climate models.

4. Frankly, the studies on climate engineering are not great and still in their infancy. Many studies on injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere model it stupendously crudely: they simply reduce the solar constant in a climate model by an amount that they assume Aerosols would dim sunlight. The reality is, injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere wouldn't be as simple as reducing the solar constant by a uniform amount globally. Aerosol can move. Aersol can interact with longwave radiation as well as shortwave. People of course know this, but modeling the physics precisely is a challenge that is still being incorporated into studies.

5. While I'm not an expert outside of the science side of things, I can't help but think about the international effort required to accomplish climate engineering. It would require international cooperation, tremendous technological advances, and money. A question: is it really easier to stop climate change by using engineering rather than using more sustainable infrastructure? To me, both climate engineering and developing sustainable infrastructure face the same difficult hurdles mentioned earlier: international cooperation, technological advances, money. So to me, it's not clear why climate engineering would be an easier way to solve the problem. Perhaps some people on this thread think it's necessary to work on both climate engineering and reducing CO2. Another question: would the resources spent on climate engineering be better spent on developing sustainable infrastructure? (I think you know my opinion on this).

Final thoughts: 
1. I want to mention something also many people on this thread probably don't realize. Most climate scientists oppose implementation of climate engineering. I work at a lab that employs _many_ climate scientists. Nobody here thinks it's a good idea. Even people studying climate engineering at my lab don't support it's use. 
2. This is far from an exhaustive list of drawbacks. 
3. I focused on Aerosol injection in the stratosphere, but other geoengineering schemes, such as cloud brightening, have been proposed. These face similar problems. 
4. I support further study of geoengineering. A model Intercomparison Project for it exists and is called GeoMIP. Note even GeoMIP acknowledges the potential for dangerous consequences associated with geoengineering. See: http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/geomip/

Edit: also wanted to mention that the only intervention I do support direct air capture. This is because zero emissions doesn't reverse global warming. We need direct air capture to cool the planet. See: https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/blog_held/23-cumulative-emissions/

Edit 2: It seems from the comments I have a bit to learn about DAC and the different methods of drawing down CO2. I'm not informed on the drawbacks DAC vs other methods. In complete honesty, I wrote DAC but was incorrectly using it to express my opinions about CO2 drawdown in general. All I know is this: we need negative CO2 emissions to reverse global warming. Temperatures _stabilize_ with zero emissions. Maybe DAC isn't the best way to accomplish negative emissions, but we do need negative emissions to reverse warming.",STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL INJECTION

Even what is generally called a worst-case scenario of climate change [still assumes](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959378016300681-gr2.jpg) that the global population will stay similar to today's levels or increase, while the GDP will continue to increase throughout this century.

> It is therefore also inevitable that aggregate consumption will increase at least into the near future, especially as affluence and population continue to grow in tandem (Wiedmann et al., 2020). Even if major catastrophes occur during this interval, they would unlikely affect the population trajectory until well into the 22nd Century (Bradshaw and Brook, 2014). Although population-connected climate change (Wynes and Nicholas, 2017) will worsen human mortality (Mora et al., 2017; Parks et al., 2020), morbidity (Patz et al., 2005; Díaz et al., 2006; Peng et al., 2011), development (Barreca and Schaller, 2020), cognition (Jacobson et al., 2019), agricultural yields (Verdin et al., 2005; Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007; Brown and Funk, 2008; Gaupp et al., 2020), and conflicts (Boas, 2015), there is no way—ethically or otherwise (barring extreme and unprecedented increases in human mortality)—to avoid rising human numbers and the accompanying overconsumption. That said, instituting human-rights policies to lower fertility and reining in consumption patterns could diminish the impacts of these phenomena.

The issue with geoengineering is that it would have to be maintained for centuries and/or very gradually tamped down if it at some point ends up infeasible. A sudden interruption of geoengineering does not appear to have been studied much, but it is generally believed to have significantly worse consequences than not doing any geoengineering in the first place due to the sheer rapidity of the rebound.",COMMENT

era9ljn,t3_c0st6r,Taxicum,1,0,"If you had a garden and had a problem, like say a fungal problem or a plague of one particular disease or pest. There are three ways you can react.

1. You can rely on a combative unrelated *strategy* to erradicate it. When you do this you don't learn why you had the problem in the first place. You try to solve the problem without caring much for the reason you had it. You might guess but you can't know. You aim at getting the solution you *think* you want. There is margin for error and you may be wrong. 

2. You ignore it.

3. You observe. You look at what new information the problem is trying to give you about your garden and how it works. You ask what the problem is trying to teach you and trust that through observation the solution presents itself. You ask what it is calling your attention towards.

Both working with the land and permaculture has taught me that when you try to control a problem with a *combative* strategy, it keeps coming back. You can inadvertantly find yourself committing to keep going with the syrategy indefinately. The problem can also pop up again as another problem in a different part of the garden somewhere or as something else. You changed the problem but without fully understanding it. You may also become reliant on using more and more combatative strategies as time passes and getting more and more disconnected from understanding the original problem as it plays out. You can also sometimes make matters much worse than they were by intervention. 

When you ignore it, some times the problem goes away and self regulates. Sometimes it gets really really spectacularly bad and out of control until you reach a crisis point before it changes. If you ignore the problem the only certainty is that the problem will *change,* but you can't predict how. 

When you step outside the problem and observe, paying attention closely, you find the problem actually contains the seed of the solution. There was a reason you had the problem in the first place and the solution was there all along. You can then deal with the original reason it happened and find what the garden needed. The answer not only presents itself to you but by the end of the process your understanding of the garden has deepened. This third way is incompatable with the first, if used together, the waters are muddied.

Heres a concrete example: I had a problem with buttercups in my garden. I relied on a strategy to get rid of them, I pulled them out. I spent a ton of energy pulling them out(!) over and over and over again. Someone watching me struggle took pity and taught me permaculture principles. The buttercups weren't my enemies they were helpers, trying to send me a message and teach me about my soil. My soil lacked, among other things, calcium. Buttercups are dynamic acumulator of calcium. The soil was trying to correct the problem itself. They were messengers from the soil teaching me about the soil I had. Slowly and incrimentally with expert support I began to change the soil and give it what it needed. No more buttercups.

I have reason to wonder why solving problems on a bigger scale outside the garden would be any different.",COMMENT

So there will always be more emissions benefit from reducing the need to extract the carbon to begin with, than from building green energy to run carbon sequestration, up until some future tipping point.

One way to do that is cleaning up the grids, building transmission from high renewable potential areas to low-potential areas. But as with all things climate, it is complex.

The US has many non-interconnected grids, and even if the direct air capture potential for one region is high, the most suitable place for renewables to be built in terms of emissions may be outside of it, where it can displace the most hydrocarbon extraction. It's kind of a paradoxical situation where even if you pay to sequester your personal carbon emissions now with DAC, the actual emissions-optimal use of your money might have been investment in green energy elsewhere in the world, while you continue to emit.

But once the grid is cleaned up, and other sources of hydrocarbon demand are addressed, then it starts making sense to undo the centuries of emissions than brought the atmosphere to this point, and this map could indicate where that future industry could boom.

In order limit global warming to 1.5°C, the most urgent task is drastic emission reductions.

But we're at a point where reduction is not enough anymore. 

We need to remove emissions as well to help address CO₂ emissions that are extremely hard to avoid (residual emissions) or that have accumulated in the atmosphere (historic emissions).  
The United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change (IPCC) estimates that direct air capture and storage needs to remove up to 310 billion tons of CO₂ by 2100 in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C.  
This demands the technology’s fast and drastic scale-up.

Enhanced tax credits through the IRA is expected to give carbon capture projects a boost in coming years; the IRA offers tax credits of up to $180 per metric ton, up from the $50 per metric ton that was previously offered.

SS: A very sobering reality for people who imagine a world where climate change can be reversed with any currently feasible technologies. To capture current CO2 emissions yearly would require 3.7 hectares of land to be replanted with forests and we would run out of arable land within four years. 

Another startling fact the video explores is the huge inefficiency and extreme quantities of energy direct air capture uses. To scale up direct air capture and then maintain CO2 emissions at 450PPM would require the entire world's energy supply currently. To return it to preindustrial levels of 350-380PPM would require 2-3x the entire world's energy supply. The only way to reasonably end climate change is to stop using fossil fuels because there's no technologically feasible way to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and research and development into the problem is critically underfunded.

These are trial programs and won't cure the cancer but at least they're bringing attention to reduction of existing CO2.

EDIT: 
The bot moderator wants me to include more detail on the post so here it goes...

This (up to) 1.2 billion dollars is meant to advance two DAC facilities in Texas and Louisiana, and the overall program is meant to kickstart a nationwide network of similar sites.  We know that we are currently in the anthropocene, and also the sixth (or so) mass extinction, caused by our own activities. One of the significantly harmful activities is burning of fossil fuels, contributing to increased atmospheric (and then ocean) CO2 concentration, which then increases global average temperature. We are already well past the level of CO2 that was considered safe at one time (350ppm) and it is likely that we'll need some kind of system that can reduce that concentration if we are to reduce the impact of our already committed atmospheric pollution, and provide a possibility to avoid climate related collapse.

1392aif,Adam Something doesn't understand direct air capture or environmental economics,I_like_maps,207,49,"The Youtuber Adam Something released [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJslrTT-Yhc) entitled Carbon Capture Isn't Real. In short, this is a horribly bad, terribly research video and it gets everything wrong. Thankfully, it's only 4 minutes long, so explaining why shouldn't take too long. And again, seeing as it is only 4 minutes long, I'm not going to go into much detail on the arguments Adam makes, it's a very short video so you can watch it if you want more detail. 

The first mistake, and this is a big one, is that he labels the technology he's talking about wrong. The technology the video refers to is direct air capture (DAC), a technology that allows for the capture of CO2 directly out of the air. Paired with carbon storage underground, this technology would allow CO2 from the atmosphere to be removed and stored elsewhere. Instead of calling this technology direct air capture, he consistently calls it ""carbon capture"". This isn't so much a problem for the information contained in the video, but it is a broader problem because it confuses the conversation on the topic. Carbon capture technology tends to refer to point-source carbon capture which you might find on a cement factory for instance. The thing is, *that* technology is [unambiguously going to be essential](https://www.iea.org/reports/cement) for getting to net-zero. We have no way to decarbonize cement production at scale without carbon capture and storage technology, since cement production requires seperating carbon from calcium in limestone, leading to carbon that we have to deal with. And we can't just stop producing cement because the global population is still going up, and billions of people currently live in inadequate housing. 

This might sound like a nitpick, but the problem is that it spreads misninformation around the technology more generally. For comparison, it would be like labelling a video ""electric cars are bad"" and then making the entire video about problems with Tesla specifically. Problems with one application of a technology doesn't delegitimize it as a whole. 

However, the ""problems"" he cites here come down to a misunderstanding of environmental economics from Adam. Adam's argument boils down to this: direct air capture technology is currently really energy-intensive and expensive to run. This is: 

1. a waste of energy because increasing the amount of energy we use makes decarbonizing harder and 

2. is a waste of money, because there are cheaper options to lower emissions than DAC

This sort of makes sense if you're thinking about how to best *lower* emissions, but that isn't actually the goal we need to achieve to solve climate change. In order to solve climate change we don't need *lower* emissions, we need *zero* additional emissions. We need to get to net-zero emissions per year, and then remove carbon from the atmosphere to return the earth to its pre-industrial state as a result of the damage caused by the emissions already there. And DAC is going to play an essential role in that. So remembering that our goal is not lower, but zero emissions, let's take a look at Adam's two criticisms. 

Let's start with the second critique, that there are cheaper ways to lower emissions. He's right that investing in public transit is much cheaper than DAC - I mean obviously. The thing is that there are emissions from a lot of different sources in the economy, and the costs of eliminating them run along a curve, called an abatement cost curve. I spent 8 hours on photoshop putting together [this detailed graph](https://i.imgur.com/7cX8XZa.png) as an example. Essentially, different measures for eliminating emissions have different costs associated with them. Renovating buildings with more insulation and more efficient lighting for instance, is often considered to have a negative cost associated with it, because you're saving energy which can actual be profitable. Up the curve from that, you have replacing coal with solar PV. Now, in some cases this is already profitable, especially if it's an older coal plant. If it's a newer plant though, the sunk capital cost increases the cost of abatement though, so what we're looking at here is an average. Up from that, we have replacing an internal combustion engine vehicle with an EV, and more expensive than that is installing carbon capture and storage on a cement plant. There are obviously loads of other abatement costs in an economy, this is just an example. 

This is critical to why most economists support carbon taxes as the best solution to climate change. We steadily increase the cost of emitting emissions, until polluters are incentivized to stop emitting because it costs more to emit than to abate. You steadily increase the carbon tax until emissions are out of the economy. 

Now, if we're looking at what's cheapest in lowering emissions, obviously we should be starting with energy efficiency improvements and switching to clean forms of electricity. But wouldn't it be absurd if I were to make a video attacking electric cars because ""why aren't we instead doing cheaper stuff like energy efficiency?"" The answer is we are, but we can't stop there because there's still tons of emissions left in the economy. Getting to net-zero is going to happen over the next three decades by starting with the cheapest emissions and move our way up until we've eliminated emissions from the whole economy. And some of those emissions are going to be extremely difficult to get rid of. 

So for example, air travel creates a lot of emissions. Options for eliminating air travel emissions are extremely limited right now though. Hydrogen might be a possibility, but likely not for quite a while. Batteries are likely always going to be too heavy for long distance travel. Biofuels are a possibility, but scaling them up to be used for all air travel will be extremely difficult. In many cases, it will likely end up being cheaper to simply emit the CO2 and then sequester it than to invest in producing expensive hydrogen or biofuel supply chains. And when the cost of offsetting a ton of CO2 with DAC is cheaper than abating it, there's no obvious reason to not offset with DAC. 

The advantage of DAC is not that it lowers the cost of abating extremely expensive emissions. [Here's a visualization](https://i.imgur.com/JEYczWX.png). Effectively, we're setting a baseline, for the cost of abatement. For emissions that are very difficult to get rid of like air travel or maybe industrial emissions of some sort, it now makes more sense to get rid of emissions with DAC than to invest in alternatives to creating them. 

So DAC may not be important today, but investing in it will be critical in order that we can lower costs enough to do it at scale by 2040-2050, when it might be critical to cheaply lowering emissions. 

I hope it should now be clear why the first point Adam makes here about the cost of powering the equipment is silly. By the point we're using DAC at scale as a solution to climate change, we'll have long-since had a net-zero emission energy grid because doing that is dramatically cheaper than building DAC. 

I hope that's all fairly clear. I wrote this in one sitting, so let me know if any of my points need clarifying.",DIRECT AIR CAPTURE

Yes there's super cheap options now, but as you say many are exhaustible! Cannot clad and insulate everything. Once we hit carbon intensity of electricity of 0 (or close, 100% green energy) as you point out there'll still be emissions from certain processes (anything non-electrified.)

Even if everything is now electric as you say we want to actually have negative emissions to reduce carbon intensity to reduce net radiative forcing to cool earth.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, attacking it DAC for being uneconomical is true-- this can be a useful counterpoint to the growing number who like to rationalize inaction (sacrificing anything today for more enviro land/capital tmrw) by pointing out it's not certain it'll scale, and to what degree, as it in fact complementary to things like green energy (and carbon taxes as you mention) and strictly worse (now) than cladding and such. 

&#x200B;

The key issue I think you're trying to highlight is less so people attacking DAC for being expensive now, but conflicting DAC and CC as a whole and writing off both concepts

1. In the now it may have people see **direct carbon capture** as bad, overly costly or some carbon accounting trick, reducing output dedicated to abatement today.
2. And in the longer term writing it off (DAC) as a concept it will deter investment, which is quite terrible because it's the ""abatement of last resort"" and any investment /research and so cost falls would be great.

We have observed very surprising cost falls in newer tech like solar PVs, no reason to write off DACs (I personally am less hyped for DACs just because there's so very many things to abate more cheaply between now and then-- but I encourage investment for exactly this reason!)

Artic ocean.  

14 miilion km^2 lets use 10 million so we don't effect gay whale or polar bear habitat.  

At -40 C it is 233 K.  At -3C it is 270 K.  

(270/233)^4 = 1.80.  An 80% increase in radiating.  

This is a huge underestimate.  Water vapor rises so we should look at radiation from the top of the atmosphere.  Plus the ice sheet is usually covered in white snow.  A poor radiator. Replacing it with flowing water or ""nilas"" would be a much better radiator.  Liquid water evaporates much faster than frozen ice will sublime.  

Since we are using the windmills for direct air carbon capture we must have CO2 available as a refrigerant.  

Pressurized CO2 liquid in the relatively deep arctic ocean can soak up heat and increase pressure.  The above surface radiator tower can dump heat into the air.  This can drive a carnot cycle engine.  The theoretical limit is a low efficiency.  We do not care about the energy efficiency.  We just want high heat transfer to the air.  The deep water approaches the freezing point and salty water sinks while fresher water rises as ice.  This upwelling spreads across the ocean surface.  

To keep things really moving heat use a horizontal spin on the wind turbines.  All fall and up until the big freeze it can leverage the upwelling as an agitator.  After the big freeze it can just windmill as windmills do.  Or it can impellor pump liquid water up on top of the ice sheet.  

I think the vertical cross section should have a wineglass profile.  The stem being icebreaker tough.  It has to resist excessive ice pressure.  The base is just heat exchanger pipe.  Then the cooling tower and windmill is above surface as the ""glass"".   The cooling tower is also where you collect atmospheric CO2.",COMMENT

k1i2qj9,t1_k1hy99m,the_syner,1,1,">Artic ocean. 

The ocean would be a heat sink & doesn't increase earth's radiating capacity. At least not permanently.

Whether we're using liquid CO2 or water vapor in big updraft towers it's a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built & the upper atmosphere isn't big enough. If we're looking at 2×10^17 W of electricity, assuming 50% generation efficiency, most of which isn't being purged at more than 400K & the large majority of that will be a lot closer to 300K(assuming 350K), that means we need a little over another earth's worth of surface area. To match that we would need our radiating shell to extend anoth 2639 km. The upper atmos doesn't even begin to cover it. Even with 90% power generation efficiency.

It's still gunna take some honkin big radiating structures.",COMMENT

You have to make a kWh of electricity 4 times cheaper than a kWh of heat from combustible dirt or combustible dirt automatically wins.

Edit: also note that the levels of CO2 today are far above preindustrial. So it could take a lot of direct air capture before we'd get a big shock to the system. This is another reason why it's probably not worth being concerned about.",COMMENT

In other words:
- Without any intervention, CO2 radiative forcing increases. 

-With intervention limited to halting emissions, CO2 radiative forcing stops increasing, but it doesn't decrease to zero due to ocean heat uptake. 

-With intervention that includes DAC and halting emissions, only then will CO2 radiative forcing decrease significantly enough to bring down temperature.

This is a good question. I actually do not know, and it may be model-dependent. One way to think about RF is as a measure of how much the increase in CO2 changes Earth's equilibrium temperature:

RF ~ ∆T / CS

Where CS is climate sensitivity and ∆T is the change in equilibrium temperature. Since CS is widely uncertain, it is likely the case that the RF needed to cause a reduction in global mean temperature is dependent on the model.

I didn't know this until I started my postdoc a couple years ago. So it's not your fault! Somehow, this important piece of information doesn't find its way to public eyes, or even to many scientists. It was discovered in ~2009 or so, so it isn't super new, but not super old either.",COMMENT

**WASHINGTON, D.C.** — As part of President Biden’s Investing in America [agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov),  the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced up to $1.2 billion  to advance the development of two commercial-scale direct air capture  facilities in Texas and Louisiana. These projects—the first of this  scale in the United States—represent the initial selections from the  President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded Regional Direct Air  Capture (DAC) Hubs program, which aims to kickstart a nationwide network  of large-scale carbon removal sites to address legacy carbon dioxide  pollution and complement rapid emissions reductions. These emissions are  already in the atmosphere, fueling climate change and extreme weather  and jeopardizing public health and ecosystems across the globe. The Hubs  are expected to ensure meaningful community and labor engagement and  contribute to the President’s [Justice40 Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).  Together, these projects are expected to remove more than 2 million  metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year from the  atmosphere—an amount equivalent to the annual emissions from roughly  445,000 gasoline-powered cars—and create 4,800 good-paying jobs in Texas  and Louisiana.    
 

Today’s announcement will be the world’s largest investment in  engineered carbon removal in history and each Hub will eventually remove  more than 250 times more carbon dioxide than the largest DAC facility  currently operating.",DIRECT AIR CAPTURE

If it takes the equivalent energy of a barrel and a half of oil to convert a barrel of oil back to oil (likely an underestimate) then you can save half a barrel of oil more by not burning the oil in the first place. Every energy transfer in this universe is lossy.

The problem is energy, expressed as time. Burning fossil fuels is nothing more than expending the stored solar energy of millions of years over mere decades. The rate is problematic. Solar fuels don't solve that problem in general, although they can mitigate specific applications, like air travel, where we don't have a high aggregate engineering learning high energy density alternative and won't for some time.

jvzln17,t1_jvzdicz,aqa5,5,1,"najaaaa, ist halt von hinten durch die Brust in Auge. Klingt mir nach Leuten, die lobbyiert haben, um am Emissionshandel Geld zu verdienen anstatt dass mittels Gesetzen die Hersteller zu weniger CO2 verpflichtet werden. So, wie damals unter Kohl statt Glasfaser eben TV-Kabel gelegt wurde. Da hat sein Kumpel gut dran verdient und wir bauen erst heute Glasfaser so richtig aus, weil das Kupferzeug nicht mehr genug leistet.

So wird schmutzig hergestellt, das CO2 in die Luft gepustet, dann das CO2 wieder energieintensiv eingefangen und damit etwas kompensiert, was man von vornherein hätte verhindern können. -> mehr Energieeinsatz, mehr globale Erwärmung.

Würde man das CO2 nicht erst in die Athmosphäre lassen, wärs geilerer Scheiß.

(Man könnte jetzt noch mit ""cool, dann haben wir gleich E-fuels"" kommen, aber die sind noch unsinniger als Wasserstoff im Auto.)

(Auch was die notwendige Energie angeht: macht nur Sinn, das aus komplett erneuerbaren Energien zu speisen, sonst setzt man CO2 frei um CO2 zu fangen...)

(Ach, einen hab ich noch: e-Fuels binden zwar CO2, lassen es aber wieder in die Atmosphäre beim Benutzen, ist also Quatsch wenn man CO2 aus der Athmosphäre holen will. Deswegen wollen die Projekte es unter die Erde pumpen. Das ist halt noch mehr Quark. Wir holen Erdöl aus der Erde, verbrennen es, haben ein bisschen Energie. Dann erzeugen wir mit Erneuerbaren Energie, holen das CO2 ineffizient wieder aus der Luft und pressen es wieder unter die Erde. Was haben wir gewonnen? Klimaerwärmung. Was haben die Betreiber gewonnen? Viele Gewinne.)

(Das Ganze klingt auch so ein bisschen so, als würden die Erdölkonzerne Lösungen anbieten, den Schaden zu begrenzen um weiterhin ungestraft Öl an Autofahrer zu verkaufen)",COMMENT

Natürlich müssen wir solche Anlagen bauen. Sogar sehr viele davon. Immerhin haben wir die Weltmeere mit Kohlensäure angereichert die wieder entnommen werden muss. Die Meere weiter zu killen, wäre extrem dumm.
Bereits ca 2000 Mrd Tonnen CO2 haben wir in die Luft geballert, eine Menge die da wieder raus muss.
Ich hoffe wir schaffen es das Einfangen von CO2 ebenso auszubauen wie auch unseren Ausstoß zu Verringern. Beides hoffentlich rechtzeitig um uns zu retten. Ich sehe dieses Experiment, Mensch, ernsthaft in Gefahr.

In der Zwischenzeit wo wir beides tun, sieht es total absurd aus, das wir kohlebagger arbeiten lassen und die kohle zu verheizen und ein Stück weiter das CO2 aus der Luft fangen und am besten gepresst in Briketts wieder in den Boden zu legen. Eine riesige Arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahme.

Zb die Moore in Deutschland, wo es echt nur noch wenige gibt, sind aktuell bei ca 6% des deutschen CO2 Ausstoßes beteiligt. Wenn die wieder aktiv und geschützt werden machen die für Deutschland -6%. Das sind 12% Verbesserung ohne dafur irgendwas erfinden zu müssen. Es braucht weniger als 10 Jahre bis die Moore wieder gut in Schuss sind.

From the article: A U.S. climate tech company has developed a project that could remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually.

CarbonCapture Inc. has revealed plans for the largest carbon capture facility in the world in Wyoming, in an exclusive partnership with premier carbon storage company Frontier Carbon Solutions, according to a press release published by Business Wire last week.

""With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the proliferation of companies seeking high-quality carbon removal credits, and a disruptive low-cost technology, we now have the ingredients needed to scale DAC to megaton levels by the end of this decade,"" said Adrian Corless, CEO, and CTO, CarbonCapture Inc.

""We plan to have our first DAC modules fielded by the end of next year and to continue installing capacity as quickly as modules come off our production line. Our goal is to leverage economies of scale to offer the lowest priced DAC-based carbon removal credits in the market.""

Massive amounts of CO2 can be removed from the environment by connecting direct air capture (DAC) devices that CarbonCapture has developed and deployed in enormous arrays, as per the company description.

The companies chose Wyoming due to the state's extensive supply of renewable and carbon-free energy sources, as well as its advantageous operating and regulatory conditions for carbon storage.

Edit: To those saying we can't take the money from the companies because it will just be passed onto consumers, and this is politically unfeasible... Who do you expect is going to pick up the tab for large scale carbon capture anyway?  And some economies have already imposed ""windfall"" taxes for their price gouging.  Are our laws really powerless to prevent them from simply passing this this additional cost onto consumers, and for that matter, wouldn't this additional revenue just be circular and again captured by this profit skimming?  I think we are aren't as powerless here as we want to pretend we are.  I think a movement is growing to do this as we move further and further into calamity.  It's estimated that addressing climate change would require about \~2% of global GDP per year, it seems possible this could be entirely funded with fossil fuel profits in the near term.

ioouevs,t3_xfs9hd,Atmos_Dan,28,3,"I’m an atmospheric chemist that now works in carbon capture. 

The technology described in this article (direct air capture, “DAC”) is going to be one of the most important ways that we lower CO2 levels in the coming decades and centuries. Part of the problem with climate change is that many GHGs have a relatively long lifetime in our atmosphere. We already have positive warming feedback loops starting up (e.g. permafrost thawing releasing methane) so our atmosphere will continue to warm, even if we hit the Net Zero Emissions scenario by 2050. Unfortunately, many natural solutions like planting trees won’t put much CO2 into long term storage. DAC acts as a carbon sink, putting CO2 into geologic reservoirs or using that carbon for applications with very long lifetimes (such as steel and iron production). 

DAC isn’t our only tool to reduce CO2 mixing ratios but it’s a damn good one. Each plant is small but any quantity of negative emissions is a step in the right direction.  

We can also use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for post combustion capture to help reduce the impact of hard to decarbonize industries (cement, chemicals, etc). Again, CCS will be one tool for us to use in combination with fuel switching, optimization, electrification, and many other strategies.

All the while new renewable energy sources are being adapted, new policies in place, new efficiencies to reduce emissions, and suddenly the emissions in question are down say 7 percent, making the facilities even more effective.

Unfortunately we're at a point where reduction is not enough anymore. We need to remove emissions as well.

To be specific: The United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change (IPCC) says the use of carbon removal technologies is already “unavoidable” if we want to meet our climate goals, and that by 2050 we’ll need to remove and store 5-16 billion tons per year.

The Swiss company Climeworks this month hit a milestone when, for the first time, an independent third-party verified the startup's novel technology for sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it underground.

""We need a standard, because a ton of carbon dioxide removed by Climeworks is not the same as, for example, afforestation. Maybe the trees burn or decompose. They may not last 1,000 years or even 100 years, let alone millennia like what we do.""

1300 Gt of Co2... gives us about 130 trillion dollars to suck all the human caused emissions out (not counting transport and storage costs)...

World gdp is around 80 trillion, lets round up... with a 4% world gdp growth rate...

4 trillion dollars a year, would mean zero growth necessary for 30 years.


So, assuming we stop emitting tomorrow... and plow the entirety of our gdp growth back into removing CO2, i.e. zero investment and maintenance in current capital stock... then we may resolve the climate crisis for all future generations at the cost of atleast three generations... 

why 3? because capital stock loses 4% every year, 30 years basically means the remaining capital decayed to 30%... Doubling requires 18 years and so 36-45 years to grow back assuming we can grow at previous rates with green energy which is doubtful imo.

We must go lower than that, to cool down the global temperature and slow down or turn off the positive feedback loops that are increasing the warming and emitting even more carbon. Even with 420ppm, the rate at which the global average temperature rises is at a rate of a few tens of degrees, if things become urgent there will be no change of trends until CO2 is below enough preindustrial levels.

Anyway, there might be alternative ways to remove that much.

Geometric progressions can reach very high numbers in relatively short time. There may be a kind of ""machine"" that could do the trick: biological agents. Maybe not trees, but microorganisms, something that uses CO2 and maybe very little more to make more copies of itself. Maybe some kind of transport or distribution would be needed to spread it, or that it becomes airborne.

The problem is, first, that is not invented/created yet probably like with other biological entities, that you can't turn all of them off, and, as the mathematician of Jurassic Park said, life finds a way. 

A non biological way could go around catalysis, but usually more things are needed (energy, light, heat, some other elements/molecules), and not sure about distribution in a safe way.

We are failing at Carbon Capture at the source (our best hope) and are currently putting 33,000 Mt of carbon a year into the atmosphere. The largest effort of ""Carbon Capture"" right now is capturing it at the source in powerplants has failed to meet expectations. We were expecting 80% and instead we are at 40%.(1)  
  
Trying to capture CO2 already in the air is a joke in terms of scalability and efficiency. 15 currently constructed plants in Europe only pull 9000 tonnes a year. We are projected to have a 10 Mt capacity by 2030. (2)  
  
33,000/10=3,300. Meaning it would take 3,300 years of continous running at our expected 2030 capacity to remove the amount of CO2 into the atmosphere.  
  
It is estimated by 2100 (lol at us getting there and still having advanced technology) we would require 83,333,333,333 Mwh of energy per year to power the carbon capture plants. (3, converted 300 Exajoules to Mwh to make next calculation easier)  
  
In 2019, the R.E. Ginna nuclear power plant actually generated a total of 4,993,693 MWh, achieving an annual average capacity factor of about 98%. (4)  
  
83,333,333,333/4,993,693 = 16,687 Nuclear Powerplants that would be required to generate the energy requirements. For reference, there are currently 443 Nuclear powerplants currently operating.

Then you just need some sort of media for sorbing it, or perhaps a labile intermediary for exchange with another system.  Also a source of energy to drive the endothermic stages.",COMMENT

The following submission statement was provided by /u/dumnezero:

---

Science Sunday: the study is based on models looking long-term (relative to us): the next centuries. It assumed a continued rise in atmospheric CO2 for the next 140 years and a decrease for 140 years after that. 

>In the study, the researchers modeled the changes to the air circulation pattern called the Hadley Cell, which transports moisture from the equatorial regions toward the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which lie at about 23.5 degrees north and south of the equator, respectively. Scientists have known for years that the Hadley Cell circulation responds to climate change by expanding toward the poles. The humid air that rises from around the equator gets dumped back to Earth at higher and higher latitudes, causing worsening droughts in subtropical regions. 

The climate driven by HC patterns doesn't bounce back quickly. Also, TIL, how/why the climate system tends to pump water towards the poles. 

And the main reason for this lag seems to be the oceans:

> ""It's related to ocean circulation. The response of the ocean is always slower than the removal of the carbon dioxide, and how fast the ocean responds then determines the recovery of the Hadley Cell.""


https://www.space.com/carbon-removal-does-not-reverse-climate-change-effects

This is related to collapse because, firstly, the prolongation of climate chaos for some centuries likely means more extinctions in the Mass Extinction, and it means that the futurist faith in ""carbon negative"" technology to undo the damage caused by GHGs is less likely to be a fix. To make a topical analogy, the climate system has long-Heating or global warming sequelae.

Capturing it WHERE it's generated is much better return.  But obviously we can't put a metric ton of basaltic rock into the trunk of every car to capture the CO2.

Storing carbon from the air as a solid (the end product is making calcium carbonate, the same stuff insect exoskeletons are made of) is just one example of CO2 sequestration u/AlkalineHume describes in the top comment.

Gasoline is a very complex hydrocarbon, which means, at a molecular level, its a long chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. 
Once we extract the CO2 from the air (CO2 seperation), it has significantly more uses. In addition to forming solid balsaltic rock and burying the carbon waste in the ground, we can convert back into a complex hydrocarbon. In other words, we can recycle the bad carbon from the air back into gasoline.

The theory and methods behind this process have been extensively explored and documented. In fact, there are thousands of different ways carbon dioxide from the air can be recycled into useful hydrocarbons. Applications of hydrocarbons range from energy storage (super efficient batteries, essentially) to transportation (gasoline), and they also allow us to keep existing infrastructure in place. Researchers from accredited universities have gone further, and constructed economic models of countries based on this potential technology.

# Here are some basic facts:

Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO2. Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases. [\[Source\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions)

Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, meaning they allow light through to heat the Earth's surface. When the Earth emits that heat as infrared radiation the greenhouse gases absorb it, trapping the heat near the Earth's surface. As the planet heats up it causes changes like the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, amplifying global warming. [\[Source\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide)

Of the 1300 Gt carbon dioxide from anthropogenic emissions over the last 200 years, about 38% of that has already gone into the oceans. [\[Source\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide)

The oceans store 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere. 39,000 GtC (gigatonnes of carbon) currently reside in the oceans while only 750 GtC are in the atmosphere. [\[Source\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide)

# This doesn't even take into account:

Ocean acidification leading to the [release of more CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification) since acidic water can't dissolve as much CO2.

As temperatures rise, soil begins to [increase the release](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874) of carbon (soil respiration).

Or that higher oceanic water temps will release more dissolved CO2 (think coke bottle on a hot day).

Solutions exist (ocean alkalinity enhancement, direct air capture, cultured meat, etc.) and don't get me wrong they do seem viable. The problem I see with most of these is how do you make them profitable? People love to rail capitalism, but at the end of the day if you can't find a way to make climate change mitigation profitable its gonna be hard to enact international change. Idk.

Only possible option that I see, is to change our whole global economic system. Let's ditch capitalism and take the resources from the hoarding bastards that are driving the largest portion of this shit show. Let's allocate the bullshit jobs to work that is purely for the climate. We have to embrace degrowth. With it we have more time to take care of each other and enjoy simple things that really matter. Friends, family, reading, philosophy, swimming (I love it..), sex, cuddling, art, countless movies, shows and video games, playing, gardening, etc. 

There is so much useless stuff made in this world just to sell for money. This is ridiculous. This is so wasteful. We should be using our resources and energy smarter. We fucking named ourselves HOMO FUCKING SAPIENS. BUT NO! ""Wise man"" or ""knowledgeable man"", yeah this is complete bullshit (actually real bullshit is more valuable and useful than the name homo sapiens). You can enslave others humans just by owning stuff and having money in this system, make others work for you, pay them 1$ and profit 2$ for the work they did, and sell the products they produced back to them for more than it's worth. Just because you own some stuff. We have too many people running in the hamster wheel of capitalism, in search for better stuff, better life, money whatever. It is not worth it. Of course, some of us are trapped in it, forced to work some meaningless job to earn a living. This is tragic.

Oh no, but what I am suggesting is socialism/communism! I don't fucking care. The system I am dreaming of isn't perfect, but it would be hell of lot better than this awful, cruel thing. (tax money going to infra, police, fire department are all good, but omg universal healthcare! social security! that is absolutely evil \s)

I tried to vote the smartest person/party and talk with people, make better consuming choices. It's not enough. I feel the governments of the world have failed us. I am angry, sad and depressed.

In particular, plants grow slower when CO2 is scarce, but animals keep doing their thing, so biology would create a net CO2 source.

There is vast amounts of CO2 stored in seawater: if atmospheric CO2 dropped, some of it would move from ocean to atmosphere to replace what was lost.

These two processes together remove about half the CO2 we are currently adding to the atmosphere, and would be equally effective in reverse.

But the CO2 removal process wouldn’t be.  All known free-air carbon capture technologies get less efficient the less CO2 there is.

Not only because of the temperature, but also because plants need CO2 to survive. If we remove too much CO2, it might negatively impact plant life on the planet.

hgd8qu5,t3_q6n8y2,KnoWanUKnow2,69,3,"All plants are different.  The current concentration of CO^(2) in the atmosphere is around [420 ppm](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) (parts per million). As an aside, in 1980 it was 340 ppm.

We know from greenhouse studies that most plants will survive at levels as low as 150 ppm.  Some will survive down to about 50 ppm.  Below those levels most plant's can't photosynthesize.

So we could more than half the CO^(2) in our atmosphere and plants would still grow, although not as fast as they currently do.

You see, we know from [closed greenhouse studies](http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-077.htm) that plants grow faster if there is more carbon dioxide available.  The growth rates are pretty proportional right up to around the 1000 to 1500 ppm levels (depending on the plant), after which growth rate levels off and then starts to decline.  At around 2000 ppm CO^(2) actually starts to become harmful to plants.  It becomes harmful to people at around 5000 ppm.",COMMENT
hgf2ldq,t3_q6n8y2,RoryJSK,33,2,"There are examples of this if you look back in the earth’s geologic history.

One example is the Carboniferous Era.  

With the advent of a new organic compound called lignin, which makes up the woody structure of vascular (upward growing) plants, there came a problem—when plants die and fall to the forest floor they get munched on by microbes and fungi, in a process we know as ‘decay’.  These organisms use enzymes to break down the plant matter in order to make it palatable.  

These organisms then fart greenhouse gases like methane and CO2 back into the air.  The problem was, no organisms had yet evolved which had an enzyme capable of breaking down this new lignin compound.

Plants take in CO2 from the atmosphere and use the C (carbon) atoms to make organic compounds (like lignin) and they release the O2 (oxygen) back into the atmosphere.  So now we had all these plants taking CO2 out of the air, but there weren’t any organisms that could break down lignin and return the CO2.

As a result we got this great big deposit of organic matter which now makes up a lot of the oil deposits we tap into, today.  This is also why we call that period the “carbon”iferous.

So, getting back to OP’s question… what happened?  Well, it turns out several things happen when you turn up the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere relative to other gases.  For starters, oxygen feeds fire.  So you would get so pretty gnarly forest fires!  These would release some CO2 back into the atmosphere.

Another side effect—many insects breath through holes in their skin… not with lungs, but by the slow permeation of air through these holes.  It turns out the size of insects is limited by how much air can pass through these holes.  But by turning up the oxygen you make it easier for insects to breath.  And as a result you get bigger insects!  Say hello to foot long dragonflies!

In summary, some things happen that counteract some of the change, almost like nature has ways of stabilizing the atmosphere.  The problem we face today is that if the level gets TOO high, the opposite can happen, and we can get a feedback loop that continues to make things worse.

The earth will ultimately survive climate change.  But life (as we currently know it) is at risk.  Many people don’t like to let nature change.  Others might see it as a natural evolution cycle.  But either way I think we can all agree that it is important to try and take care of our planet, regardless of which side of that argument you stand on.",COMMENT

I asked CHATGPT 4, twice:

**

Certainly! Let's rephrase the question for clarity:

""How much would the price of gasoline increase if a carbon tax of $100 per ton of emitted carbon dioxide were implemented?""

Now, let's proceed with the calculation:

Tax Rate Conversion: Convert the carbon tax from a per-ton rate to a per-gram rate. Since one ton is equivalent to 1,000,000 grams, a $100 per ton carbon tax translates to $100/1,000,000 per gram.

CO2 Emissions from Gasoline: The average CO2 emission from burning gasoline is about 9,170 grams per gallon.

Increased Cost Calculation: Multiply the CO2 emissions per gallon of gasoline by the tax rate per gram to determine the additional cost per gallon of gasoline.

Let's perform this calculation:

Upon recalculating with the refined understanding of the question, the result remains the same. With the implementation of a carbon tax of $100 per ton of emitted carbon dioxide, the price of gasoline would increase by approximately $0.92 per gallon. This calculation is based on the average CO2 emissions from burning gasoline and assumes a direct pass-through of the carbon tax to the gasoline price

**

for the low price of .92 cents a gallon we can cancel out all future gasoline fuel emissions. IF the technology improves and the tax remains the same, then we can even scrub past gasoline emissions.",COMMENT

Here's the actual paper: [J. Hansen et al., Young people's burden: requirement of negative CO2 emissions. *Earth System Dynamics*. **8**, 577–616 (2017).](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-577-2017)

> **Abstract:** Global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea level, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location requires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial Holocene range. However, global temperature excluding short-term variability now exceeds +1 °C relative to the 1880–1920 mean and annual 2016 global temperature was almost +1.3 °C. We show that global temperature has risen well out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as it was during the prior (Eemian) interglacial period, when sea level reached 6–9 m higher than today. Further, Earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying that more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to predict, but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting global warming thus, at minimum, should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or higher levels for centuries. Such targets now require negative emissions, i.e., extraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices, including reforestation and steps to improve soil fertility and increase its carbon content, may provide much of the necessary CO2 extraction. In that case, the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the natural range of the current interglacial (Holocene) could be limited and irreversible climate impacts could be minimized. In contrast, continued high fossil fuel emissions today place a burden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction if they are to limit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or air capture of CO2 have minimal estimated costs of USD 89–535 trillion this century and also have large risks and uncertain feasibility. Continued high fossil fuel emissions unarguably sentences young people to either a massive, implausible cleanup or growing deleterious climate impacts or both.",COMMENT

174j5b7,Seeking Advice for Designing a Water Scrubber for CO2 Removal in Biogas - Thesis Project,Glittering-Item6867,1,4,"Seeking Advice for Designing a Water Scrubber for CO2 Removal in Biogas - Thesis Project

Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on my thesis project, and I need some guidance on designing a water scrubber prototype to remove CO2 from biogas. The prototype should be around 1 meter in height and i need to scrub 50L of biogas. My main goal is to achieve a CH4 concentration of 90% in the final gas mixture. However, I'm facing some challenges in getting started and making crucial design decisions. If anyone with experience in this field could provide some advice, hints, or point me in the right direction with relevant literature, it would be immensely helpful.

Here are the key aspects I'm struggling with:

1. Flow Rates: I'm unsure about the appropriate flow rates for both the biogas and water. What should they be to effectively remove CO2 while maintaining the desired CH4 concentration?

2. Biogas Pressure: What should be the ideal pressure for the biogas entering the scrubber?

3. Design Equation: Which equation(s) should I use as a basis for designing the scrubber? Are there specific models or theories that are commonly applied in this context?

I appreciate any insights or resources you can share to help me kickstart the design process for my prototype water scrubber. Thank you in advance for your assistance!",CO2 REMOVAL

1- If you just have an oxylite bin on the bottom layer for o2 generation, it can delete co2 so you don't need a pump and filter. 

But it can lead to overpressure and cause popped eardrums. So I usually have 1 bin submerged in water or naphta or w/e with 20t of oxylite, and another higher prio bin with 2t oxylite, which is not enough to cause popped eardrums.

2- A bit exploity, but if you just keep your dupe in an atmosuit, you don't need o2 generation at all. Once the suit runs out of air, they will gasp for air but not actually consume any o2. 

If you had a data collection module there, this would not be ideal as it would slow down their data collection with all the interruptions. But it looks like this is just for exploration, so it should not have a major downside.

If predators only accumulate 10% of the biomass that they eat, the point is that 90% remaining is being used in respiration, which we all know produces CO2. If we catch these predators, this 90% biomass that would have been used for respiration, would still be biomass. Two options remain then, either we catch the fish that were not eaten by predators (in which case the CO2 production would remain constant), or we don't and their bodies fall to the bottom of the ocean when they die, effectively capturing that CO2.~~

1/ that in terms of atmospheric concentration, 1 tonne emitted leads to a stronger increase, than the decrease of 1 tonne removed

2/ But in terms of temperature, 1 tonne removed leads to a stronger decrease that the increase cause by 1 tonne emitted. 

3/ Then says, “there’s basically a lot of uncertainty, answer may be way different if another climate model is used”.
